	Wrap incoming content in a box that removes it from the regular
	page flow. You *probably* want to wrap any text you pass in with a
	`<div/>` of class `yak-content`, though other elements (images,
	iframes, etc.) are best left unwrapped. Because of this, you almost
	certainly want to pass in HTML rather than markdown, though we use
	`markdownify` to make any incoming content safe, just in case.

	Expects two variables:

		`layout`
		One of `left`, `right`, `center`, or `full-bleed`. Defaults to
		`center`.

		`content`
		Content to be put in the box.

	There is also an optional parameter:

		`extra_class`
		Additional class(es) that will be added to the outer `<div/>`.
		Useful for controlling positioning for fancy formatting.

	Note that this widget outputs HTML in a safe way, and is thus
	suitable for inclusion in both Markdown and HTML pages.
