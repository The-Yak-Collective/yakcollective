Welcome to the Yak Collective Weekly Digest, _Yak Talk._  

Released every Friday at 12p EST, _Yak Talk_ will contain a digest of Yak Collective updates, project launches, and other announcements.  

For those not familiar, the Yak Collective is a loosely coordinated network of over 300 independent consultants, coaches, and freelancers with varied technical and creative skills.

### The New Old Home

Last week, we released our second report, [The New Old Home](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home), which offers 22 perspectives built around [Pamela Hobart](https://twitter.com/amelapay)â€™s central thesis: _as work returns to the home, we can turn to historical modes of integrated living to guide our attempts at co-located life and work._

### Now Accepting Project Proposals

Beginning today, Yak Collective is accepting proposals for collaborative projects. Submission deadline is Friday, June 26th.
