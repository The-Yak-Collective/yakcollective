Sending out a quick reminder that **Yak Collective is seeking project contributors for its second round of project ideas.**

Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

- There are four projects, and each has 2 proposers and 2 referees. 

- Each also is trying to level up previous projects in one way or another, so this third round should hopefully be an overall level-up. 

- You have until **Sunday July 5th at 11:59pm** to express interest. 

- All projects that get at least 8 expressions of interest in participating will be greenlit (though 3 of them can handle more participants). 

You can access the form to review the projects and express your interest in one or more of them via the button below.
