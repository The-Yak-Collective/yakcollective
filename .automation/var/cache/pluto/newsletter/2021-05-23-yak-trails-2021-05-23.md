#### **#yak rover project updates**

The Yak Rover project is an effort by Yak Collective to create an open-source rover design capable of being deployed on Mars by 2031. We are betting that radically declining launch costs and increasingly capable infrastructure on Mars and the Moon (such as shared communications relay or charging facilities) could open up the possibility of an open-source space program based on low-cost rovers. Weekly standing calls on Mondays include quick status updates on: last week  **lw** , next week  **nw** , blockers  **bl** , and one interesting thing  **oit**.

The Yak Rover project includes five independent rover builds.   
fmi: [Yak Rover Project](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/yak-rover/)

**Infinity and Beyond**. _Based on the ESA model rover_  
**lw**. Flew beyond outside just before Ingenuity’s flight (yay).  
Printed the bogie bearings.  
**nw**. Play with RISC-V board  
**oit**. Need to add new camera with pan-tilt to drone to see what is below the drone, since the drone-camera is fixed to the body and looking forward

**Go and See**. _A pair of simple PiCars_  
**lw**. Tried to get the new ultrasonic sensor working on the first PiCar and failed. Tried to connect a different camera to the first PiCar and realized I'll need to create a mount for it in order for that to work well enough. Continued assembly of the second PiCar.  
**nw**. Finish assembly of the second PiCar and get all of the sensors and other features working.

**Nature is Murder**. _A from-scratch rocker-bogie design_  
**lw**. Learned basic motor control circuits  
**nw**. Design a simplified chassis just for motor testing  
**oit**. Components not sitting properly on breadboards is like the most likely error always

**Abio Flex Wanderer**. _A spider-bot_  
**lw**. Play with sensor candidates to mount, including a thermal camera, an optical range finder, a laser range finder, a new camera, and seeing though ABS and acrylic.  
**nw**. Start implementing a software watchdog  
**bl**. Work for food stealing work for good.  
**oit**. Pondering a simple question: What does it mean to go forward? The problem is to find an abstract and meaningful API to command a rover to go forward (same question then for any action). The question seems trivial until considering different rovers. Wheels, legs, spheres, etc. Aside different servo commands, it is unclear to me what other data this API needs, what options, and what feedback it should provide. Example of distance forward as a feedback is hairy: Absolute distance is inaccurate, legged rovers usually have gait that makes vague actual distance. Anyway, this is the kind of polish I am trying to apply with the BOS API for rover commands.

**Wonderful Wandering Growth**. _A spider-bot_  
**lw**. tried to figure out the outdoors image quality problem  
**nw**. see if i can use some type of AGC or maybe glasses to reduce light levels and maybe help with the blooming problem. if time permits, start on some type of image processing and maybe look up a suitable SLAM  
**bl**. only %life

The #take-gig-leave-gig channel on the server is where yaks share openings.

**id14**. Was asked to spread word about this position at xxx. It’s a remote job, but you’ll need to based in the UK. If interested, please reach out to xxx  
**id18**. I am looking for a product engineer to work on a new headphone project I am looking to get off the ground.  
**id19**. looking for a graphic designer who can take technical process and architecture diagrams and make them look attractive.  
**id20**. Client is looking for a react-native front-end dev for a 2 week UI sprint towards launch. Being able to start immediately is a plus.  
**id21**. Looking for wearable UX developer. Target platform is probably Wear OS, but this is currently more of a prototyping/exploratory engagement so this is negotiable since the hardware isn't locked yet.  
**id23**. cool job alert: xxx is hiring a Head of Creators and a friend is leading the recruiting for the role. who's the right person for the job?  
**id26**. came across this 6-week research project for a food business thought someone here might be interested.  
**id28**. Looking for a lead UI/UX/Product designer and biz/legal ops intern/associate for my new startup.  
**id29**. Urban tech startup xxx is looking for a contract mobile developer, for a small project, to get an app on the app stores (it’s a single-task app for sensor installers, with no commercial activity on the app).  
**id30**. Justice tech startup xxx is hiring a Product Designer!  
**id31**. A friend of mine is looking for a web designer to help launch a web page for a start-up he's working with. Scope of work is to help determine overall design style, illustrations, and UI/UX assets; bonus if it can be done in webflow, or even better — implemented end-to-end.  
**id32**. Working as a contractor through xxx, a fellow consultancy is looking for someone with Drupal 8 to 9 upgrade experience — doesn't have to be UK based or have government clearance, for once.

#### **#soapbox**

The #soapbox channel on the server is for yaks to give a little speech on what’s on their mind re: internal affairs at Yak Collective. A sort of ongoing townhall to ensure that things on people’s minds get articulated and aired. Extracts from recent posts include:

> ... “architecture of gathering” ... an airports vs communities metaphor for how/why people gather ... recommend airports as both normative and descriptive models / [#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/829810073194201128/844981896684765254)
> 
> It seems like what’s beginning to happen here is that the current core members . . . are starting to align on what it is that we're doing here . . . a place for indie knowledge workers with a bias for action to come hang out and have interesting interactions that lead to interesting projects that can mutualistically signal status to the outside world the virtue of both participating indies and the YC.... / [#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/829810073194201128/831937097408839690)

> 
> I’m going to shamelessly steal and riff on an idea that Kim Stanley Robinson spoke about in a small talk I participated in on from his book _Ministry for the Future._ That book, for those that haven’t read it, is a sorta pragmatically optimistic take on how the next several decades might unfold in a scenario where we kinda sorta muddle our way through the climate crisis.... / [#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/829810073194201128/834273098948935731)
> 
> ... an understanding of engagement that’s based on time-patterns of activity. There is continuous active presence, continuous partial presence, occasional surge drop-in participation, spikey drive-by participation in things like yakathon, pass-through contribution to projects without further contribution to YC as the sponsoring org, etc. We should encourage and enable all these. / [#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/829810073194201128/837779009646755858)
