Herewith a roundup of what Yak Collective indies have been up to this past week. Yaks can jump on the server to join in. If you’re not yet a Yak Collective member, [check us out](https://yakcollective.org/) and consider [joining here](https://yakcollective.org/join).

## **#yak rover project updates**

- **Stubborn. ** Completed next iteration of command language. Much more usable. Operability tests performed by a 6-year old to great success. Will plan to focus more on drivability. FFWD command, for example, kicks so hard it registers as an impact. Need to develop some sort Attack and Decay concept. Each time the rover would break due to either my software or a loose wire, the 6-year old assume it was her fault. Being more accepting of faults seems like a critical engineering lesson to teach.

- **Wonderful Wandering Growth.** collected images to use for trying out various stereo/sfm/flow algorithms, and ideas and papers thereon. sunglasses using polarized strips, maybe from an LCD display, more work on vision and/or on closed loop. stereo is still hard. insight: reality has a surprising amount of detail. instead of trying to regularize it, maybe rover can glorify in it and use it. added some twitter functionality. consider twitter polls

Last night @vgr was explaining Reubleaux triangles and I almost fell out of my chair trying to show off my sweet clock.

One of my favorite scientific figures is this one of the entropy levels of 100 world cities by the orientation of streets. The cities with most ordered streets: Chicago, Miami, & Minneapolis. Most disordered: Charlotte, Sao Paulo, Rome & Singapore. Paper: [appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.10…](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0189-1)

When you generate images with VQGAN + CLIP, the image quality dramatically improves if you add "unreal engine" to your prompt. People are now calling this "unreal engine trick" lol e.g. "the angel of air. unreal engine"
