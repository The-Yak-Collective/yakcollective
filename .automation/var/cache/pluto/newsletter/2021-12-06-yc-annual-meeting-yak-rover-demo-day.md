Greetings!

The Yak Collective will be holding **TWO events** in the next week or so. Both events are virtual (Zoom) and free, but you do have to register, since attendance is capped for both.

On **Sunday December 12th, 1500-2000 UTC** , we will host the very first **Demo Day of our flagship 2021 project, the Yak Rover project**. We will do demos of the rovers we’ve been building all year, host discussions on the future of robotics, open-source space programs, and much more. There will also be orientation sessions for those interested in getting involved for 2022. There are plenty of ways, both technical (all skill levels) and non-technical, to get involved.

On **Tuesday December 14th, 1500-2000 UTC** , we will host the **Second Yak Collective Annual Meeting**. There will be reviews of last year’s activities and projects, discussions and brainstorms for next year’s projects, and opportunities for both new and returning yaks to get oriented/reoriented, and get involved for 2022. If you’ve been looking for the right opportunity to get involved/re-involved, this is it.
