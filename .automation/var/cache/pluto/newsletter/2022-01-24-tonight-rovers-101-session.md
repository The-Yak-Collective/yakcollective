If you’ve been looking for the right opportunity to join the [Yak Rover](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/yak-rover/) project, and perhaps build your own rover, or contribute a piece to someone else’s, tonight’s Yak Rover meeting might be for you. Build leader Anuraj will be leading a discussion on how to get started, including low-cost kit options to suit every budget. We’ll talk about every level of the rover stack from mechanical and electronics design to single-board computer options, programming, and simulation. Whether you’re a newbie without much technical experience or an experienced robotics hacker looking to get into rovers, we’ll get you going.

**This is part of our regular weekly meeting track on Mondays at 9:45 PM US Pacific (Tuesdays 0545 AM UTC).** To join tonight’s session, [join our Discord](https://www.yakcollective.org/join/) and then drop in to the **#yak-rover** channel where we hang out. The zoom link will be posted there shortly before we start.
