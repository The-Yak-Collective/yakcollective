Dysthymia What We Were Given We Did Not Know for Marvin Bell Once the thing is inside you, you can travel with the ash-coloured leaves awhile, and sip the dark pools in passing without fear of homesickness or thirst. Absorption is gradual, as the clay-mud knows, though once the platelets are convinced, it will swim through the dark capillaries, seeking the nuclear light of an innermost self.
