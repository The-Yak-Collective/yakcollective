Hi there Innovation at Scale readers! I have an announcement today that I think will be of interest to any readers of Innovation at Scale.

I’ve been collaborating with [The Yak Collective](https://yakcollective.org), a loose network of independent consultants, and today we published our first collective effort, a deck of 25 creative and unexpected provocations, ideas, and action frameworks to navigate the Covid-19 crisis:  
**[Don't Waste the Reboot](https://yakcollective.org/projects/yak-wisdom)**

The goal is to offer organizations of all sorts — business, nonprofit, government — a real and meaningful alternative to traditional mainstream sources of advice, counsel, and intelligence for navigating this crisis.

Please do check it out, and pass it along to people in your organization who could take inspiration from some of our ideas!

The deck is organized around six core themes:

- Response & Learning 

- Experimentation & Innovation

- Reboot Mental Models

- Sensemaking & Storytelling 

- Complexity & Resilience 

- Deploying Indies 

My contribution to this deck is Idea #1, Responsiveness \> Preparedness. You can find it on slide 13, including a brief case study about [H-E-B’s COVID response](https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/heb-prepared-coronavirus-pandemic/), which you might recall from a previous issue of this newsletter.

There are lots of other interesting and challenging ideas in the deck; a few personal highlights for me were:

- _Designing for Continuous Adaptation_ by Vaughn Tan, which offers organizational responses to the “succession of new normals” that will follow the present crisis

- _Surfing on the "Edge of Chaos"_ by Paul Millerd, which offers insights on how to design an organization as a “complex adaptive system”

- _Restructure as a Small-World Network_ by Vinay Débrou, about the sweet spot between disparate bets and tightly coupled strategies when planning for uncertain futures

- _Reverse Anthropology_ by Jordan Allen, about the role that outside viewpoints can play in driving organizational change  

**About The Yak Collective**

The Yak collective is a network of independent consultants who all have their own consulting practices, but also work together on larger projects. If you are intrigued by an idea/framework, feel free to reach out to the relevant contributor directly. The Yak Collective is not an agency or intermediary. We are trying to develop a very different approach of developing and delivering business ideas and intelligence based primarily on effective and fluid collaboration models inspired by the open-source software world. You can learn more about us at our new website, [yakcollective.org](https://yakcollective.org)

**Like bits and pieces of what you saw in this deck?**  Feel free to contact one or more individual contributors directly! The Yak Collective is not an agency or intermediary. Our members collaborate because they want to, and each of us maintains their own independent consulting practice. We offer you a catalog of ideas and people to choose from, not a bundle.

**Like a lot of what you see?**  Contact [Paul Millerd](mailto:pmillerd@gmail.com) to loop The Yak Collective into your reboot efforts. We will assemble the right small team and set of ideas to work with you, in whatever way is most effective. It might be a study or report. It might be facilitating a workshop or series of conversations for your executive team. Or it might just be an ongoing conversation with one or more of us.
