Roam is a note-taking [tool for networked thought](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) which I find incredibly powerful. One of the exciting aspects of using Roam is joining a community of curious minds interested in [metacognition](https://nesslabs.com/metacognition) and [thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps). While Roam is a pleasure to use out of the box, this community has created many browser extensions to improve your experience of Roam Research.

If you are new to Roam and not sure where to start, read my [beginner’s guide to Roam Research](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-beginner-guide) first. It will get you started in a few minutes.

## Highlighters

The easiest place to get started with browser extensions for Roam is with a highlighter. A highlighter will help you select, copy, and automatically format text you read online so you can paste it into a Roam page. Here are a few options:

- [+Roam bookmarklet](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-bookmarklet). Built by yours truly, this was the very first highlighter created for Roam. As such, it’s pretty rudimental. But the code is open sourced so you are free to edit it and repackage it to create your own bookmarklet. As a bookmarklet, it works with any browser.
- [Roam-highlighter extension](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter). The big difference with this extension built by Shawn Murphy is that you can select several highlights at the same time, making it faster to import lots of content from a web page into Roam. You can also bulk import Kindle notes and highlights ([demo](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter#demo-8---extract-highlights-and-notes-from-kindle)). Works with Chrome and Firefox.
- [Roam Highlighter extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-highlighter/hponfflfgcjikmehlcdcnpapicnljkkc). (yes, both these extensions are often confused because of the similar names) A beautifully designed extension by Daniel Wirtz. Highlight text, add tags, customise the format of your text clippings with placeholders, and jump to the next open Roam tab to quickly insert your highlights. Available for Chrome. 

At their core, all of these Roam extensions do the same thing: let you clip content from web pages to import into Roam, but they have a slightly different approach. For instance, I prefer having a bit of friction by importing web clips one by one, which acts as a forcing mechanism to be selective, but other people need to be able to clip lots of content at once. So have a look and pick one you enjoy using.

## Roaman

This extension by Eran Boodnero is all about the tiny changes in Roam’s UX that will boost your productivity.

For instance, Roaman:

- Highlights the scope of the block you are currently typing in, which is especially useful when typing long notes with lots of blocks.
- Automatically adds brackets when you type a hashtag, so #… becomes #[[…]] — extremely useful as well if you tend to often use multi-word tags in Roam.
- Autocompletes pages you want to link to by typing the first letters then CTRL + SPACE, which will fill the rest of the page title with the first entry in the contextual menu.
- Lets you quickly delete a page by clicking CTRL + DELETE.

If you ever forget about a particular shortcut, don’t worry: the extension button shows you a list of everything it does.

## Roam Toolkit

Dubbed “a Roam force multiplier,” this extension by Vladyslav Sitalo is probably one of the most advanced browser extensions for Roam.

- **Fuzzy dates.** Type “two days ago” or “in three weeks” between semicolons and it will autocomplete it with the right date between double brackets.
- **Block actions.** Quickly delete, duplicate, or copy blocks using shortcuts.
- **Live preview.** You can quickly preview a page by hovering over a link. The best thing? These previews are interactive, meaning you can quickly edit their content without having to fully open them in the side panel.
- **Tasks estimates.** Helps you calculate the total time several tasks will take by using Roam attributes and an automated query.
- **Spaced repetition.** Roam Toolkit uses metadata in blocks to build a spaced repetition system right inside of Roam. It implements Anki’s popular spaced repetition algorithm and shortcuts, so if you’ve been using Anki in the past you won’t be too lost.
