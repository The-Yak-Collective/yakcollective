I read a self-help book about performing well under pressure. The following is a blunt reinterpretation of the material to record what I think might be helpful in the present moment. I alone am the intended audience.

Work less, if you can. But if you can’t…

## The Heuristics

A [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) is a cognitive shortcut for decision-making. It is not guaranteed to be rational or even correct. It serves only to help you get to “good enough” in the short term.

Here are ten to try in bad times:

1. “The challenge is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. That’s what I’m here to do.”
2. “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ isn’t my only chance. There will be more in the future.”
3. “I don’t actually _have_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It’s really all optional.”
4. “The original mission was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. That’s my focus.”
5. “Things that can go wrong: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. My plan for each: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
6. “Even if it all goes wrong, I can live up to my values by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
7. “I’ve done work I’m proud of before, including \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
8. “Things that can go right: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. My plan for each: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
9. “Only \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ matters in the present moment. I will focus on that.”
10. “The only things I can control in this situation are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

## Heuristic 1: Reframe as a challenge.

“Positivity is bullshit, but I _will_ feel better if I _act_ as if the task at hand is a challenge. So, fine. The challenge is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

## Heuristic 2: Not the last chance.

“No matter what it is that I’m working on, this probably isn’t the only chance I’ll get to do something _like_ it. There will be more chances for me to succeed. It may not be _this_ chance, but there _will_ be more.”

## Heuristic 3: Everything is optional.

“Nobody can make me do anything. There might be consequences, of course, but other people’s priorities are _theirs_, not _mine_. The importance of any particular task _to me_ is then only a function of how important _I_ decide it is.”

## Heuristic 4: Focus on the mission.

“Worrying about the outcome won’t help. The mission I am here to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I can only do the best I can with what I have towards that intent.”

## Heuristic 5: Rehearse the bad.

“I can’t know everything up-front, but I can take some decent guesses about ways this can go wrong or get worse. I can list these ways out and rehearse in my mind what I’ll do for each one.”

## Heuristic 6: I am not the outcome.

“My identity is not defined by whatever ends up happening. My values are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Even if everything goes wrong, I can still choose to live up to them.”

## Heuristic 7: Review past success.

“I forget that I’m capable, that I’ve done things I’m proud of, and that I _do_ have expertise. To remember, I can review the _evidence_ of my past work.”

## Heuristic 8: Rehearse the good.

“Things _could_ go well, in a couple ways. I can rehearse in my mind what I’ll do in each case, so I stay aware of the upside and ready for opportunities.”

## Heuristic 9: Deal with _now_.

“The situation is already in motion, and I am _in it_. All that matters is what I can do _right now_ to make it better or make it worse. The present moment demands I care only about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

## Heuristic 10: Control what you can.

“There are so many things I cannot control, but there are a surprising number of things that I _can_. I can and will exert complete control over \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

## Final Thoughts

These heuristics are largely based on the book _Performing Under Pressure: The Science of Doing Your Best When It Matters Most_ ([affiliate link](https://amzn.to/3hCIPRc)). I won’t go as far as to say that it’s a good book, but I do appear to have gotten something out of it.

A few other influences were present for me as I wrote this post.

[Jabe Bloom](https://twitter.com/cyetain) taught me about present thinking and “the event” concept. I am grateful to him for helping me play with both of these ideas:

_Anticipatory Awareness_

[John Cutler](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish) taught me to use the fill-in-the-blank structure for thinking about the very real conversations we have with others and with ourselves. Structuring ideas in terms of conversations brings us closer to actually _acting_ in those ways. It’s completely changed the way I think, and for that I’m also grateful.

Finally, a critical concept present to me while writing this post is conditions-consequences thinking, from Derek M.C. Yuen’s _Deciphering Sun Tzu: How to Read the Art of War_ ([affiliate link](https://amzn.to/301JmGx)). My good friend [Tasshin](https://twitter.com/tasshinfogleman) has written about it in [_Means-Ends, Conditions-Consequences, and the Game of Risk_](https://tasshin.com/blog/means-ends-conditions-consequences-and-the-game-of-risk/). The conditions in play always present an abundance of opportunity, no matter how little control we think we have.

## Addendum

Two additional heuristics that did not fit with the others but that might also be useful:

1. **Music** — something energizing, focusing. Perhaps a song for each project, to listen to before work begins.
2. **Focusing Metaphor** — A vivid reminder of how to be, such as “like water.” Something good happens? “Be like water.” Something bad happens? “Be like water.”
