**Books I’ve Recently Finished:**

- [Discrimination and Disparities](https://www.amazon.com/Discrimination-Disparities-Thomas-Sowell/dp/154164560X) by Thomas Sowell

- [Charter Schools and Their Enemies](https://www.amazon.com/Charter-Schools-Enemies-Thomas-Sowell/dp/1541675134) by Thomas Sowell

I started reading these after coming across [this review of Sowell’s life and work](https://www.city-journal.org/thomas-sowell-race-poverty-culture). I think these books were written around the same time so they repeat some of the same examples and anecdotes. Overall very good. Not much I hadn’t heard before but presented very clearly. You could almost use as a primer on critical thinking. I’ll work on a review.

**Books I’m Still Reading:**

- [Diminished Democracy: From Membership to Management in American Civic Life](https://www.amazon.com/Diminished-Democracy-Membership-Management-Distinguished/dp/0806136278) by Theda Skocpol (This is quite dull so far but it came highly recommended, so I will continue)

- [From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.com/Here-Equality-Reparations-Americans-Twenty-First/dp/1469654970) by William A. Darity and A. Kirsten Mullen
