Packy says that his differentiation “is that I’m going to be having more fun than most people”

I’ve been a big fan of the energy he’s brought to his writing over the past couple of years. But he didn’t set out to have a [popular newsletter](https://notboring.substack.com/).  His real plan was to launch an in-person community.  

We chat about how the pandemic helped him figure out why that wasn’t a good idea and how he’s thinking about his solopreneur journey,

The reason I asked him on the podcast is to talk about his [recent newsletter on the future of work](https://notboring.substack.com/p/were-never-going-back).  He argues that “Employees will ultimately make the decision” about what work looks like post-pandemic.  I think he is mostly right and we talk about what that might mean for people’s lives.

## Quotes

On his competitive advantage

> My only differentiation…is that I’m going to be having more fun than most people”

On making friends

> What you write about defines who you’re going to spend a lot of time interacting with…It better be something you’re interested in or those conversations are going to be painful.

On how much he likes his new relationship with work:

> I can’t imagine having to go back to a job where I have to work for somebody and two go to an office every day.  Once you’ve had a taste for the other side it seems like a crazy constriction of optionality.”  

On having no goals:

> Right now I feel really good not having goals…there’s been enough serendipitous things happening that Im comfortable not setting those goals.
