Steph has a hard time identifying as anything.  Remote worker, writer, or coder don’t really do it justice.  The thing that stands out when you talk to Steph is that she is a LEARNER.  Through competing in chess as a child she learned the valuable meta-skill of how to improve and never really saw any reason why she couldn’t just take something up.
