### How can we change the world? Exactly — join us and we’ll see!

If you follow me, you might have heard this thing called ‘systems thinking’ or ‘complexity’ or ‘cybernetics’. It’s about:

-\> knowing that to do anything, we create a frame and make sense of the picture inside — how the patterns form and connect. And knowing that redrawing that frame will allow us to see differently

-\> a set of core, often counterintuitive ‘laws’ which seem to illuminate aspects of \*how the world really is\*

This is \*humbling\* stuff — because it makes you realise that the world is infinitely complex and that everyone has their own unique perspective.

And it’s powerful, practical knowledge of how to work to achieve shared outcomes in complexity.

**An invitation**

If you’d like to hang out with me and explore this, there are loads of opportunities over the next few weeks — details in the reply.
