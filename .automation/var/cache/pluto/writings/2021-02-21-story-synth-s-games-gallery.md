I just created a gallery page for Story Synth, check it out: [Story Synth Gallery](https://storysynth.org/Gallery/)

My aim is for it to be an easy space to find and play some of the great games being designed on the Story Synth platform. It currently has 5 games on it – two by me and three by others. I plan to add a bunch more as I get more designers releasing games on the platform.

If you want your game featured or need help making your game, please reach out!
