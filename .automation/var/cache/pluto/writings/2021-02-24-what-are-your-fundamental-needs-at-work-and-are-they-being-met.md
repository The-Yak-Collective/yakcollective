I’ve been asked to share more of me personally — well, this isn’t quite that! But it’s a neat little video, twelve minutes long, with Ben Mosior:

We have six fundamental needs:  
- certainty and comfort (sameness, predictability)  
- uncertainty and variety (newness, unpredictability)  
- love, connection, and belonging  
- significance and uniqueness  
And learning/growth (personal development), and contribution to the world.

(These needs come from many places — several of my heroes including Scitovsky, Beer, and Oshry point to them — but they are most clearly spelled out, to my slight embarrassment, by cheesy-but-good self-help guru Tony Robbins)

To meet and harness these human needs in organisation, we need:  
- honest conversations  
- clarity of relationships, roles, tasks  
- learning  
- a positively-shaped culture that promotes psychological safety and discretionary effort  
- a good and clear intent — impact in the world

Which of these needs is best met by your current work? Which is lacking?
