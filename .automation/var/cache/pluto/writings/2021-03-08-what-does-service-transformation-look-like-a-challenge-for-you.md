_the situation_

Let me take you back to a great team I worked with, when we were stuck in dysfunctional patterns (still sadly familiar in many organisations today) — and ask you how we got out of it.

**I’m going to come back on Friday and give ‘the answer’ — what we actually did. I’ll answer any questions in the comments!**

\>\>The situation:

\> Shepherd’s Bush Advice Centre served the most excluded and vulnerable people in the borough with different types of expert advice.

\> We were open very irregular hours due to staff availability and demand

\> There were loooong waits and limited time appointments for customers. Nothing got fixed in the 20 minutes they got with a random specialist adviser (not matching their need), so files were made and appointments set up with the specialist

\> This caused another load of hassle, as people missed appointments etc

\> People often waited up to four hours to be told we didn’t provide the service they needed

**What would \*you\* do to make improvements? We made some small ones — then a big leap!**
