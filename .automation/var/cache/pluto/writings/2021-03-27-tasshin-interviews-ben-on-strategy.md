This is a rapidfire overview of strategic methods that Tasshin Fogleman and I recorded back in July of 2020. Heâ€™s edited it together for the _Reach Truth Podcast_, which you can check out at [his YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCmbzS-6GBfBwKCa8AkmIjg).

I recommend watching the video directly on YouTube, since there are important links in the description that provide context for the discussion. Reach out to [Tasshin](https://twitter.com/tasshinfogleman) or [me](https://twitter.com/hiredthought) on Twitter if you have any questions. Enjoy!
