- It’s about #sensemaking hard until you know what is really going on, to get to the root cause of wicked problems and solve them
- Everything is connected, so everything is a #livingsystem — it’s quite mystical, really
- You start from designing an idealised future state
- #Hierarchy is bad — we need leaders to run #systems instead
- Agile is all about systems thinking, and so is Team of Teams, and other cool things
- We’re educated to not use our critical thinking facilities — and anyway we only use 10% of our brainpower
- It’s more powerful if you also draw on the solid insights of #neuroscience
- Because of #complexity, nothing can be predicted
- Systems thinking is old, but good, but limited. Complexity is brand new, and it’s a science, so it’s better. #Cybernetics is a bit old and weird, and only slightly disturbed people still study it.
- The best way of telling them apart is to look at what people call themselves
- But we’ll never approach the insights of the old Masters
- The things on the left side are not as good as the things on the right side (but sometimes they switch the order, so you gotta be careful)
- It’s confusing, but fortunately, there are a few true experts who can tell you the answer
- What have you learned? Wrong answers only
