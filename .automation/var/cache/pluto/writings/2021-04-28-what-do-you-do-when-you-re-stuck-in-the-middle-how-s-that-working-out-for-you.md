At certain times we all find ourselves trying to \*sort something out\* — the intermediary between the Bosses and the Doers, between two teams we’re supposed to help to merge together, between the Customer and the Organisation.

X wants something from Y, but they’re asking YOU.

And guess what? Y wants something from X, but who do they come to?

Some people do this FULL TIME — for a living!

What Barry Oshry calls \*middle space\* is the most complex in organisational life.

There are more ways to get it wrong, and they resemble the ways to get it right.

Those moments when we’re ‘in the middle’ are the most fraught.

Do you:

\*Align up, and act as an enforcer for the powers that be?

\*Align down, and speak up for the poor downtrodden masses?

\*Become so bureaucratic that nothing at all gets through you?

\*Try to keep everyone happy, and run between both sides carrying messages and negotiating like the Flash… until you burn out?

It doesn’t end well… everyone thinks Middles are ‘well meaning’ but ‘wishy-washy’.
