### Would you like a nosey around my tool shed?

If you’ve read some of my posts, you might be interested in how we share and teach this stuff — organisational **#systemsthinking** , dealing with **#complexity**. The answer is the [**RedQuadrant**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) tool shed.

There are three free webinars on **Thursday 10 June**. Registration required on these links:

- 8am [https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0qf-uppjgvG9YDMBGDi09AopfOE2wF4vUa](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0qf-uppjgvG9YDMBGDi09AopfOE2wF4vUa)
- 3pm [https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYlc-6tqD4qGNEby2t9lsNGQuGHBqUWHf5w](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYlc-6tqD4qGNEby2t9lsNGQuGHBqUWHf5w)
- 8pm [https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwode6srT0jEtyVE2dFq8zRw47hiA3z33Pg](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwode6srT0jEtyVE2dFq8zRw47hiA3z33Pg)

Participants meet with me twice a month, in small groups. We go through a recognised programme of material across twelve months.

And, most importantly, we work on **#application** together, we share **#learning** , we develop **#newideas** , and we delve into ALL the material I’ve collected, developed, found useful over the course of 24 years of **#servicetransformation**.

Participants have come from Australia, Canada, the Philippines, the USA, Ireland, the Nordics — all over the world.

They’ve been agile scrum IT people, large-group futures facilitators, healthcare educators, change managers, executive leadership coaches, trainers.

If you’d like to see what they thought of it, please check the attached document.
