An essay series aiming to explore the future (or lack thereof) of the nation state. In this series we will examine the legacy of the Westphalian nation-state, its relationship to other early-modern polities from other parts of the world, post-modern forces acting on it today, and the_[longue durÃ©e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longue_dur%C3%A9e)_ futures that might emerge past the events I'm writing about in the companion [Great Weirding](https://breakingsmart.com/en/the-great-weirding/) series, which focuses on contemporary events.
