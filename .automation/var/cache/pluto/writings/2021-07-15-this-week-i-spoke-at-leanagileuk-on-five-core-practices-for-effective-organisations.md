_Graphic facilitation by Dinah Turner_

These are five \*generous\* practices — they work well for novices and sophisticates alike.

They are intentionally \*practices\*, not claims to excellence, ‘values’, or ‘principles’:

- ways to work on honest, productive conversations which work towards shared meaning and make both reasoning and emotions discussable
- ways to work towards clarity of relationships, boundaries and freedoms, tasks, roles, and project and programme purposes
- ways to build practices of triple-loop learning (do thing better, reframe understanding of the situation, evolve our own identity)
- ways to shape a culture that, through positive gut, core emotional responses to the organisation and its leaders, enables discretionary effort — passionate, full-blooded work!
- ways to keep a self-correcting measure of delivery of customer/citizen value

Supported with the right framing and facilitation (hey! this is fractal!), this helps organisations work on learning, productivity, and purpose… more links below!
