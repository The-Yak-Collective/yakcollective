#### Communal Computing’s Many Problems

If the devices aren’t designed with communal computing expectations in mind, they’re destined for the landfill.

In this [next article about communal computing](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/) we walk through five problem areas: identity, privacy, security, experience, and ownership.

[Communal Computing's Many Problems](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/)

As technologists, we often call these weirdnesses “edge cases.” That’s precisely where we’re wrong: they’re not edge cases, but they’re at the core of how people want to use these devices.

There are key questions for each of these areas:

- **Identity**  — do we know all of the people who are using the device?
- **Privacy**  — are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access? What about children?
- **Security**  — are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t? What about biometrics?
- **Experience**  — what is the contextually appropriate display or next action?
- **Ownership**  — who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?

If we don’t reconsider how these devices are designed and built they will keep getting recycled. I hope you [find this post helpful](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/) in understanding the problems.
