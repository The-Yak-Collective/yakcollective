### Speaking gigs — what do you think?

### Do you have tips how to get the best results out of them?

My mission seems to be to spread the good-humoured word about systems | cybernetics | complexity.

I wanted to change the world by transforming consultancy and transforming public services, and, well, in the words of Tesla about the ‘self-driving’ myth — ‘the real world turns out to be a lot more detailed’. So that’s on the long-term list!

I really appreciate speaking opportunities and tend to take most of them, but it’s very hard to evaluate impact: for me or the participants.

I’ve got a few coming up and so I’m preparing. I want to create a good experience and really interest and engage participants. And, as I make my money from consultancy and teaching and sharing, I want people to remember me if they are looking for support.

Of course, what I always get from these gigs is a chance to refine and sort my thinking, and a chance to listen to and network with some amazing speakers and participants — just take a look at the speaker lists to see!

Here’s what I have for the Autumn:

### \> The RedQuadrant tool shed

\> Systems Convening book launch webinar September 2

(I’m only speaking for about two minutes at this, to be fair — but it’s a good opportunity to give another plug for what I think is an important book)

### \> Australasian Change Days September 9–11

Sarah Glenister and team have again put together an event which is both an outstanding conference and a great experience of being in community. It’s in Australia — if you’re out of time zone, a discount could be available, contact me.

### \> the OperationalResearch Society OR63 September 14–16

I’m honoured and strangely overawed to be giving the systems thinking stream practitioner keynote, with Angela Espinosa giving the academic keynote, and some truly brilliant sessions in the stream)

### \> Conscious Organization October 7–8

I’m hosting and presenting on what feels like an important theme; how can organisations become more conscious? [https://www.consciousorg.net/](https://www.consciousorg.net/) (Note the website is being updated — correct dates are in October, not September)
