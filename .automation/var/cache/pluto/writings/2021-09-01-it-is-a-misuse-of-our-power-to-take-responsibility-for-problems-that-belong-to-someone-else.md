Today I want to invite you to meditate on two quotes:

“It is a misuse of our power to take responsibility for problems that belong to someone else.”

“It’s a cry out against help, against charity, against philanthropy — all forms of colonialism”

These are both from Peter Block, who wrote Flawless Consulting, Community: the structure of belonging, and many more. He’s a bit of a hero to me because of his deep thinking on what it means to intervene in complex systems… and he’s not a raving libertarian or an ungrounded realist.

Yet I find that these two quotes deeply challenge some of our most fundamental assumptions. What do they say to you?
