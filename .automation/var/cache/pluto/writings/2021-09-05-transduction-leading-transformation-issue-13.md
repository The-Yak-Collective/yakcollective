Today I want to invite you to meditate on two quotes: “It is a misuse of our power to take responsibility for problems that belong to someone else.” “It’s a cry out against help, against charity, against philanthropy — all forms of colonialism” These are both from Peter Block, who wrote Flawless Consulting, Community: the …
