They say that amongst the people of the coast, to test if you were really a shaman, you were rowed out into the cold dark ocean, tied to a large rock, and thrown overboard.

Those who could shape-shift into a fish, penguin, whale, or seal were the true shamans.

We lost a lot of good shaman that way.

Humans are born #systemsthinking, able to navigate #complexity.

Mostly, we train it out of them.

Those who survived the training become tough. Perhaps a little too attached to their leather skins and reserves of fat. Perhaps they have spent a little too long as penguins. Perhaps they even resent being tested.

Is there a better way?
