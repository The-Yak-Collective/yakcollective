#### I’ve been one, I’ve taught them, and I have two of my own. Here are the books that have stood out.

### 3rd/4th grade reading level

**The BFG, The Witches, George’s Marvelous Medicine** by Roald Dahl. Brilliant, gently scary, surprising, delightful. Mix of genders of main characters.

**Wayside School** series by Louis Sachar: _Sideways Stories from Wayside School, Wayside School is Falling Down,_ and _Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger_ by Louis Sachar — basically Jorge Luis Borges for kids, weird and unique and inspiring. Mix of genders of main characters. Please, please, please tell me you’ll give a kid _Sideways Stories from Wayside School_ to read—it might make them into a writer.

**Smile** series (_Smile_, _Sisters_, _Guts_) and **Ghosts** by Raina Telgemeier — excellent graphic novel memoirs, main characters are girls.

**Babysitter’s Club** series — the original books are fast-reading, if repetitious and a little shallow. But the recent graphic novel adaptations are truly excellent; the first few are by Raina Telgemeier, but they’re all good. Main characters are girls, without too much centering their lives around boys.

**Space Boy** graphic novels — human-focused space science fiction

**Ivy and Bean** series — brilliant, relatable stories about two 8 year-old girls who are best friends.

**Ramona Quimby** books — _Beezus and Ramona_ is the first one, not _Ramona the Pest_. These are still as wonderful as ever, and are unforgettably compassionate for Ramona’s mix of imagination and easily-bruised pride. The main characters are girls.

**Among the Dolls** by William Sleator — child-appropriate, non-bloody horror; mix of genders of main characters.

**Tumtum & Nutmeg** series by Emily Bearn. Mice who live in the walls; mix of genders of main characters, in very traditional gender roles. Nothing groundbreaking here, but the stories are clever and fun.

**Dominic** by William Stieg (erudite, but with short sentences and short length overall). Main character is a male dog; mix of genders of other characters, in somewhat old-school gender roles. A slightly harder read than the other books here.

### 4th/5th grade reading level

**Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl—utter joy. Note that _Matilda_ features some shocking abuse, though somehow in Dahl’s hands it’s palatable, which is its own lesson

**Charlotte’s Web** by E.B. White — if you haven’t read this, it’s even better than you think; a masterpiece of empathy, imagination, and beautiful sentences

**Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH** by Robert C. O’Brien—like _Charlotte’s Web_, this is suffused with fine observations, plus a compelling mix of wonder, love, and danger.

**Holes** by Louis Sachar — a clever metafictional take on racism

**Harry Potter** by J. K. Rowling—the first two books are shorter, less intense, and a bit easier to read than the rest

**Fish in a Tree** by Lynda Mullaly Hunt — good portrait of a girl living with a learning disability, my 9 year old loved it (and she’s hard to please)

**Fablehaven** series by Brandon Mull — fast-moving, smart fantasy adventure; there is danger, but it’s handled with a light touch, as in _Harry Potter’s_ first two books

**Calvin & Hobbes** comics collections by Bill Watterson— there are six or so of these, start with _The Essential Calvin & Hobbes_. They provide a joyful indoctrination into independent thinking, inspiration, imagination, and resisting the coercion and blandness of modern life.

**No Coins, Please** and **Who is Bugs Potter?** by Gordon Korman — excellent, smart comedic chapter books. There’s a bit of ambient 1980s sexism in the secondary role of women as girlfriends and objects of attention which might be worth calling out.

**Oz** books: **The Wonderful Wizard of Oz** , **The Marvelous Land of Oz** , **Ozma of Oz** , **The Emerald City of Oz**  — these are excellent (there are some others that aren’t as good; skip _Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz_, for example)

**Narnia** books — these days people sometimes foolishly start with _The Magician’s Nephew_, but you should start with _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_, then _Prince Caspian_, then _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_. People disagree about _The Silver Chair_ and _A Horse and His Boy_, but they generally agree that _The Magician’s Nephew_ is a good read, and _The Last Battle_ isn’t. Note that there’s a tiny bit of sexism from time to time, like a throwaway line where a boy sneers at his sisters and suggests they don’t read maps well, and the girls getting healing potions instead of swords.

### 5th/6th grade reading level

**Harry Potter** books 3 through 7. _Prisoner of Azkaban_ (book 3) is still my favorite, but _Order of the Phoenix_ is a damning takedown of institutional fear of dissent and independent thought, and a powerful endorsement of authentic, student-motivated learning.

**Beyonders** series by Brandon Mull — fast-moving, smart fantasy adventure; there’s some serious violence, though not gratuitous, and intense, scary situations. My daughter and I felt that the momentum sags in the third book, for what it’s worth, but the first two are fantastic.

**Singularity** and **Intersteller Pig** by William Sleator — thought-provoking, unforgettable science fiction. Sleator should be read more.

**The Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster — you don’t really need to be able to follow all of the metaphors and satirical jokes. When I read this to my kids, I changed half the male characters to female; why the heck does every talking geometry shape, anthropomorphic cloud, or faceless demon have to be male? Isn’t that a bizarre way of imagining fiction?

**Losing Joe’s Place** by Gordon Korman — excellent, smart comedic chapter book. Suffers from the same subordinate role of women as his other books, but with that called out, it’s still a gem.

**The Secret Garden** by Frances Hodgson Burnett — still magical after all these years! A slow build but a great payoff.

**Anastasia** series by Lois Lowry — like the Ramona books, but shifted a little older. Wonderful and full of unexpected surprises, minor transgressions, and fresh takes on growing into a teenager. The first book is “Anastasia Krupnik”.

**A Tale of Time City** by Diana Wynne Jones—this was one of my favorite books as a child, a strange and soaring romp through a gentle sci-fi/fantasy world, with one of the most unforgettable fictional foods you’ll ever encounter (trust me). I do confess that I started to read this to my 7 year old and the first third was too slow for her.

**Peter Pan** by J. M. Barrie — I’ve actually never read this, but my partner and other people adore it.

### 6th/7th grade reading level

**The Hobbit** by J. R. R. Tolkein, illustrated by Michael Hague — always tricky because the first 30 pages are incredibly slow, but then the rest is unparalleled adventure.

**The War that Saved My Life** , and **Jefferson’s Sons** by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley — ambitious historical young adult novels. _Jefferson’s Sons_ is a family coming-of-age story told from the point of view of Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved Black children, and it is a truly monumental, and loving, achievement; it is damning of slavery and the accommodations made for it by those who talk a good game about freedom and democracy, while also being true to the ways that the children find joy and identity in their relationships and daily life.

**The Boy Who Reversed Himself** and **House of Stairs** by William Sleator — thought-provoking science fiction, conceptually tricky and somewhat dystopian.

**The Giver** by Lois Lowry — dystopian fiction, an inspiring existentialist masterpiece

**The Golden Compass** and **The Subtle Knife** by Philip Pullman — brilliant fantasy. I didn’t love the third book in the trilogy, which, like the last Narnia book, gets into religious allegory that I find tedious.

**Earthsea** series by Ursula LeGuin — starts with _A Wizard of Earthsea_ — brilliant fantasy, but more erudite and slow than most young adult writing. The second book, _The Tombs of Atuan_, takes place in one of the most unforgettable setpieces in fantasy, and the fourth book, _Tehanu_, is a work of revisionism that looks at fantasy worlds through a feminist lens, and finds them deeply wanting.
