This newsletter was completed before the tragic death of Sir David Amess. Shocking, horrific, and yet wonderful to read the tributes to his decency from all sides of the political spectrum; yet another sad loss and another call for us to be better, kinder people.

I say ‘completed’ but, having realised Revue (despite being owned by twitter) doesn’t pull in all my feeds, I had begin going through them and chucking in the ‘most relevant’. I think I only went back about three days and there are far more than anyone is likely to ever read!

One thing I notice is that the ‘ethics’ section just grows and grows. Is that a ‘passion’ like systems ¦ cybernetics ¦ complexity — or is it just the righteous indignation that social media loves to throw at us, that is contribution to divisiveness and loss? I will have to think about that one. And find a way to make this much, much shorter.

 Here’s a puzzle for you. In a district council we worked with, there was a new housing estate nicely situated near to the commuter train station.

England may be one of the most fiscally centralised countries in the developed world, but local government still matters. English councils have budgets in excess of £50 billion. Not that you’d know it. Our political leaders seem to forget it all too easily. I’ve read again the prime minister’s statement about reforms to social care funding. He did not even mention local councils. Yet it is they, not central government, that are responsible for providing, funding and administering most social care. Local government has also been in the front line both in the response to Covid and dealing with its sometimes extreme financial consequences. Croydon and Slough have both issued so-called section 114 notices, indicating an inability to balance their budgets and the need to suspend all non-essential services. A number of other councils with specific exposures — Luton because it owns the airport, Eastbourne because of its dependence on tourism and conferences, for example — have had extraordinary additional support and borrowing powers granted…

[**The Integrator Burden — by John Cutler — The Beautiful Mess**](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tmb-4252-the-integrator-burden?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**cutlefish.substack.com**](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tmb-4252-the-integrator-burden)

Does your role involve being an “integrator” across teams?

Supporting. Connecting. Cohering. Resolving. Balancing. Listening. Translating. Absorbing.

If so, there is a good chance you have a view of your organization that no one has (not even the CEO). You see and hear things most people don’t see. You are taking on an emotional burden that most people don’t take on. And you are shouldering an emotional burden that often goes unrecognized and unappreciated…and unpaid.

 Sometimes I think about the day in January 2020 when a Number 10 spokesman told us that after the end of that month, they’d never mention “Brexit” again.

 I do sort of wonder what Gordon Brown thinks about the British press’s current near-uniform stance that the existence of economic problems in other countries makes it grotesquely unfair to blame the British government for economic problems in Britain

 And herein lies the problem. There’s an incredible amount that councils can do through innovation, better ways of working, better use of digital and data etc. We can and will do all of that. But we can’t innovate on fumes…
