 If we find the real work, we’ll find the joy… If you start from understanding the demand presented to (public) services — the actual demands that people present, their requests for service — you can get to a more fulfilling and empowering conception of public services in a very logical way.

#### [The Meaning of Liff](http://tmoliff.blogspot.com/?m=0&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=bufferd3b81&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com)

[tmoliff.blogspot.com](http://tmoliff.blogspot.com/?m=0&utm_content=bufferd3b81&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)

In Life\*, there are many hundreds of common experiences, feelings, situations and even objects which we all know and recognize, but for which no words exist.

On the other hand, the world is littered with thousands of spare words which spend their time doing nothing but loafing about on signposts pointing at places.

Our job, as we see it, is to get these words down off the signposts and into the mouths of babes and sucklings and so on, where they can start earning their keep in everyday conversations and make a more positive contribution to society.

- Douglas Adams & John Lloyd

\*And, indeed, in Liff.
