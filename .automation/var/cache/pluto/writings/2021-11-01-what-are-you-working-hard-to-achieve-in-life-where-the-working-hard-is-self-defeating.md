### Life is very simple; you are born and eventually you die, and in between, you have experiences.

### Bhaskar Goswami says that the quality of your life is the quality of experiences.

There are people who live in mansions with physical and mental anguish, and people who have nothing — except joy and comfort.

We are lucky enough to have a free workshop with Bhaskar, part of #RequisiteAgility and #consciousleadership unleashed. He’s calling it The Inner Game of #Leadership.

It is about how to thrive in all aspects of your life, how to better manage your inner state, emotions, energy and truly embody the values that are important to you.

So much of what we do in the modern world is ‘effort’.

We seek a good job, a good life, a good body, a good relationship.

And we effort hard to get it.

Then we realise that we are overworking, overstretching, that we’ve turned yoga into a competitive sport, that we are damaging our relationships…

and we add another layer of effort to achieve ‘balance’.

What if you didn’t focus on striving hard for work-life balance and try hard for every other kind of balance?

What if you just opened up to the possibility of thriving?
