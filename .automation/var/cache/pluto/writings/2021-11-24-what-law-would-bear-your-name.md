### What’s your favourite saying that you invented?\*

(\* it might be that, like mine, yours are not \*really\* unique — but don’t worry about that for today :-) )

See others’ contributions at:

Here are mine:

**Taylor’s Corollary to Pareto’s Law for projects**

the first 20% of value takes 80% of budget/time. The other 80% of value takes the other 80% of the budget/time.

**Taylor’s rule of proposal recursion**

if a proposal requires you to stay up until 3am to get it done then, somehow, so will every major deliverable on that project.

**Taylor’s law of bidding**

the more you really really care about the proposal and the work, the less likely you are to win.

**Taylor’s first rule of Workshop Time**

you will think there is not enough content for the time. In fact, there is not enough time for the content

**Taylor’s second rule of Workshop Time**

if at point x you’re twenty minutes ahead of agenda, in thirty minutes, you will be thirty minutes behind.

(To which I received:

**Pickering’s first rule of workshops:** the sooner you get behind, the longer you have to catch up.)

**Taylor’s Law of Tables Where One Side Of The Table Shows The Bad Old Stuff And The Other Side Shows The Good New Stuff**

this means that someone is using propaganda to sell you something — either a product or a worldview

**Taylor’s Law of Cognitive Hierarchies**

Any time someone presents you with a hierarchy of adult development or cognitive capability levels, they believe they are at a higher level than you.

What would you put in your name?

Shout-out to Mel Conway who has a seriously good law named after him! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

(I find it amusing that he is called @Conways\_Law on Twitter, since @ConwaysLaw was already taken — by an Irish law firm :-) )

And let’s also acknowledge Stigler’s Law of Eponymy; no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s\_law\_of\_eponymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy)

“Examples include [Hubble’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law), which was derived by [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre) two years before [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble), the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem), which [was known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#History) to [Babylonian mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics) before Pythagoras, and [Halley’s Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet), which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC (although its official designation is due to the first ever [mathematical prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley#Publications_and_inventions) of such astronomical phenomenon in the sky, not to its discovery). Stigler himself named the [sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist) [Robert K. Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton) as the discoverer of “Stigler’s law” to show that it follows its own decree, though the phenomenon had previously been noted by others.”
