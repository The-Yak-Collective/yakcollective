Welcome to the first edition published simultaneously on [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/antlerboy), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/welcome-transduction-leading-transformation-benjamin-p-taylor?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Amessaging_thread%3B3dbaf8a3-2c13-4681-bbc2-c8d37e0bc440), and now… [substack](https://antlerboy.substack.com/) (as well as being crossposted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antlerboy), [Medium](https://antlerboy.medium.com/), and [my blog](http://chosen-path.org/)). Arguably this is getting silly, but it’s just cutting and pasting. And I’m trying to find my audience!

This week saw a post I dashed off on Monday on an [‘employment contract-free future of work’](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6870996587980705792/) get an astonishing 314,000 views on LinkedIn, so I’ve blogged on that — and how I ‘hack LinkedIn’.

And we are just days away from [Requisite Agility Unleashed](https://www.requisiteagility.org/attend/ra-unleashed-conference) — you can still get a special 50% discount off the basic USD49 ticket with code

Oh, and as this is a newish newsletter for LinkedIn, I’ve pulled some content from my original Revue newsletter issues 7–9 (from four months ago).

Enjoy! Feedback welcome…

I believe that the future of work is — no jobs. The idea of an ‘employment contract’ will fade away as we realise that the whole way we understand employment is paternalistic, hierarchical, and unequal. A ‘job’ isn’t a contract between equals — it’s ‘tied service and patronage’, where ‘human resources’ exist to protect the …

Harish Jose:

In today’s post, I am looking at observation. This will be a general overview and I will follow up with more posts in the future. I am inspired by the ideas of George Spencer-Brown (GSB), Niklas Luhman, Dirk Baecker and Heinz von Foerster. In Cybernetics, observation does not mean just to utilize your eyes and look at something. It has a deeper “sensemaking” type meaning.
