### My top LinkedIn posts (you won’t BELIEVE number 77!) ;-)

I joined LinkedIn way back in April 2007, thanks to a colleague who came back from a course at the Harvard Kennedy School and told me that everyone in the US was on it. Around that period, and particularly from 2009 onwards, it was a good way to tell which public service clients were doing swingeing cuts and redundancies, as all my contacts there started to pop up on the site.

I got in early with [LinkedIn groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ji4L38JVVJiWj9EiSglY--q_rn_fr6a7G4MjnuDYK0/edit), back in the days when they were vital, exciting, dynamic places (before LinkedIn killed them), I was a LinkedIn Open Networker, I nearly got fired for mailing 20,000 group members to do a group merger (in the days you could download all the email addresses), I briefly dabbled in LinkedIn Q&As. And I’m sure I tried an app which gave me all the social media details of people I met, and possible people I was _near_ — ‘creative destruction’, rather sadly, is a constant in the tech world. And now I have LinkedIn Live capability (if they haven’t taken it away from me for not using it), and I’m trying a LinkedIn newsletter.

There’s that temptation that here are the brightest, most interesting, most creative people from every industry — connecting with them must be worthwhile!

For the last year and a half or so I’ve been posting ‘intentionally’ on LinkedIn on my areas of interest: systems | cybernetics | complexity, especially in public | service | transformation. And at some point I realised that the dozen-a-day posts I had queued up through BufferApp, shotgunning interesting links across all my areas of interest, were _not_ helpful, and reduced my regular posts to two or three a day. By ‘intentionally’, I mean deliberately trying to get my posts viewed by as many people as possible, and writing longer pieces about some of my core themes. See [this post](https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/04/how-to-hack-linkedin%ef%bf%bc/) if you want to read about the approach I used (and the people I learned from) to maximise impact.

Anyway, here’s the list, in _ascending_ order of number of views (just because that’s how I stored them in Roam), and some stats at the end. I offer this purely in the spirit of ‘working out loud’ and as an easy reference point for myself! There are some in here that are really throwaway ‘tweets’, a couple of reposts, but I cut out all the posts with views under roughly 1,500 to reduce the incidence of those. Sadly, I didn’t record the date posted.

1. 1,469 What’s your mission? [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy\_an-invitation-to-the-redquadrant-tool-shed-activity-6808284224131604480-Pewu/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_an-invitation-to-the-redquadrant-tool-shed-activity-6808284224131604480-Pewu/) What are your top three passions?
