Things seem to be getting busy in my work (in all dimensions). And the work we‚Äôre doing at both the Public Service Transformation Academy and RedQuadrant is really interesting, worthwhile stuff‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääevaluations of critical programmes around domestic abuse, mentoring for heads of library services, feasibility studies for community hubs, inclusive commissioning, continual improvement capability building, action learning, culture shaping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs exciting, and for the first time it feels like activity in the sector is back to January 2020 levels. So there‚Äôs lots of public sector, RedQuadrant, and PSTA content today :-)

And, um, there‚Äôs a lot in general this week.. but it‚Äôs **all** fascinating and important :-)

### Top phive of the week

**Get involved! The Public Service Transformation Academy will be holding open sessions on supporting approaches to strategic commissioning in adult care.**

The PSTA is currently working on a project to provide structure to adult social care commissioners to develop their strategic approach.

We are interested in hearing from all parties. If you‚Äôd like to share your experience or ideas to inform a free, open, local-government-wide tool and learning community.

There are several different ways that you could get involved. We are looking for interviewees, case studies and focus group attendees.

We are also planning to create an open learning community. This will meet for the first time on the **afternoon of Wednesday 9 February** and will meet fortnightly on four more occasions.
