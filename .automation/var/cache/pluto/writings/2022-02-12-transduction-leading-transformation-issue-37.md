 Have you ever been taken for a mug? Lied to, manipulated? We hired someone into an important #management position, with financial responsibilities. They aced all the #jobinterviews. Had great references, an engaging style. Perhaps a bit too ‘matey’, something off.

Wed, Feb 23, 6:30 PM CEST: We’re kicking off 2022 with a great topic, systems transformation, and even more amazing presenter, Benjamin P Taylor. Benjamin will introduce his ‘five worlds’ model for systems transformation, and explain the theory behind it and the practical impact of working with it.

How might this perspective impact your organisation and your work?

Brilliant stuff from John in sharing and building on great, deep insights from Barry Oshry. And something to celebrate that Barry is now 90, something like 60 years into his career of deep theoretical insights into the human condition — and, while latterly retired from ‘work’ — he still popped up to present at The Stoa recently!

John is running one of the brilliant simulations that give you the real lived experience of this on 31 March & 7 April — book here: [https://bit.ly/3AmhkGr](https://bit.ly/3AmhkGr)

The SW2020–21 Covid-19 Magazine was a free online publication about social care released during the first UK lockdown in 2020.

Five editions were published between the 9 April and 14 July 2020. There was also a special edition issue, linked to the calling of a Review of the English children’s social care system, published on 28 April 2021. All six issues are available here.

 In the future, it’s likely that the average person will not work for a company. Instead, people will earn income in non-traditional ways by taking actions such as playing games, learning new skills, creating art, or curating content. This kind of shift in how we work is not unusual or unexpected — the idea that most people would be employed by large corporations would have seemed crazy to someone in the year 1800.

 There’s this lens from games studies that I keep coming back to, the “magic circle”. All play moves and has its being within a playground marked off beforehand either materially or ideally, deliberately or as a matter of course. Just as there is no formal difference between play and ritual, so the “consecrated spot” cannot be formally distinguished from the playground. The arena, the card table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis courts, the court of justice, etc, are all in form and function playgrounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart.

 I recently saw this GDC talk by Leighton Gray, which was shared with some approval in a Discord server I’m a member of. The talk is ostensibly about game design and marketing, but it also doubles as a sort of metamodernism 101 and is largely concerned with the topic of sincere-irony. What’s interesting for me is the way it takes up this topic: it is neither an attempt at detached cultural analysis, nor does it present a world-historical vision — it is focused rather on the far more nuts and bolts realm of product design. The fundamental question it is addresses is what can be done with sincere-irony, on the small and personal scales, and in this respect it is an extremely instructive example of how this is supposed to work in practice.

 A new study by a team of researchers from Israel and Ghana has brought the first evidence of nonrandom mutation in human genes, challenging a core assumption at the heart of evolutionary theory by showing a long-term directional mutational response to environmental pressure. Using a novel method, researchers led by Professor Adi Livnat from the University of Haifa showed that the rate of generation of the HbS mutation, which protects against malaria, is higher in people from Africa, where malaria is endemic, than in people from Europe, where it is not.
