What happens when you listen to music on Spotify or watch shows on Netflix on your [communal devices](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/) in the home? How much should the recommendations adapt to everyone in the room?

In [this article I talk about](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/recommendations-for-all-of-us/):

1. Attempts from research in solving the group recommendation problem.
2. How companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon handle group recommendations today — or don’t.
3. A path forward for group recommendation services through shared norms in the home or device — rather than a focus on a person.
4. Privacy implications of group recommendation services.

Finally, I ask the question of [what makes group recommendations so hard and why do we so often get it wrong](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/recommendations-for-all-of-us/)?
