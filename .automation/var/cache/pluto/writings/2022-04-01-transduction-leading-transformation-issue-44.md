I’m on leave (umm… ‘working holiday’) — so a special ‘randomised’ version this week. Your version is unique to you, randomly generated like the Subbuteo Rugby Scrum simulator (pictured) — so assume that all serendipities are perfectly arranged by the universe for you :-)

 More wheat stats. My personal favorite Misleading Wheat Stat is “Ukraine/Russia grow 25% of world wheat exports.” Why’s it misleading? It’s technically true, but doesn’t mean what people think! Missing wheat from the war is actually less than 1% of global wheat crop!

 In this episode we explore the challenges of consumerism, which threatens to destroy our entire world… Back when I was a kid, way back in the 1950s, the council dustcart would come through our village once each week. It was a small, simple, smartly-painted old truck, much smaller than the lumbering monstrosities of today. Even at that small size, though, it was probably still large enough to serve the entire village all in one go — perhaps a thousand households back then.

 This statement is made with the assumption that there ARE mental representations and in the last 30 years hundreds of serious studies showed that the mind does not work with representations. Sadly, the representationalist view of the mind is now in symbiosis with #AI.
