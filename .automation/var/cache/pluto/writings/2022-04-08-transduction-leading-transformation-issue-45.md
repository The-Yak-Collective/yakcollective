 Omicron is far more dangerous than the Flu. Many have bought into the “Covid is now like the Flu” narrative. So here’s the science without the scientific jargon. Judge for yourself. TLDR: Like for Like — IFR X 6 Flu; Mortality risk X 32 Flu.

The benefits cap is one of the worst domestic policies of the last few decades. Just disastrous, as the Govt \*knew\* it would be.

Quote Tweet Imran @imran\_1 · Apr 1

Replying to @Samfr 20 years ago since the ‘war on single mothers’ was declared over but poverty rates for children in lone parent families have been rising due to punitive policies 63% of those hit by the benefit cap are lone parent families — 110,000 families
