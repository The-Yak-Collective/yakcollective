What is one thing you’d like to offer to adult social care commissioners to help them decide their approach? How can you make better decisions in #complexity? How do we ensure a better #future for citizens, communities — and ourselves? How can we encourage #innovation in an over-pressurised and partly broken system?

 I had a conversation with a client yesterday that I think will stick with me. He said (roughly) ‘in organisations I’ve worked in before, we used to go for those kinds of things like ‘top 100 organisations to work for’, and so we did ‘#culture audits’ where there was a lot of pressure to agree…

SAVVI — a system approach to identifying vulnerability I recently found out about SAVVI, which stands for “a Scalable Approach to Vulnerability via Interoperability”. SAVVI, led by Tameside Council and sponsored by GMCA, aims to use data to find vulnerable people. The project is developing a catalogue of datasets, their sources and the basis on which they can be used by organisations delivering public services to identify individuals or households with particular vulnerabilities, such as for the purpose of homelessness prevention. Having worked with local authority and publicly available secondary data for some time, often building specific analytical tools to spec, I saw the potential straight away of SAVVI to transform how organisations delivering public services use their and others’ data to improve the work they do and outcomes for the vulnerable people identified. Vulnerability often looks different from different parts of the system, and it can be difficult to fully identify vulnerability and people’s needs from within a single service so my hope is that SAVVI brings different perspectives across the system of public services together in the form of powerful datasets that can be used to identify, and then support, those whose needs are currently invisible.

 Great summary of Shared Prosperity Fund compared with EU funding. Not just the reductions in funds for the North but the increased role for Whitehall in decision making and the reduction in funds from 7 to 3 years. Levelling up won’t work unless Treasury is on board.
