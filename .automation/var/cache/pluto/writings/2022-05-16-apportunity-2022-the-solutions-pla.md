### Apportunity 2022 — the solutions platform

### What’s one question you would like this incredible lineup of thinkers and entrepreneurs to answer?

Here’s a really exciting conference — one which is specifically about ‘finding solutions’ to pressing problems, using the power of innovation, entrepreneurship — and technology.

Apportunity 2022 brings together the world’s most inspirational founders, global leaders, senior investors and rising stars to collaborate and share ideas — a platform for a whole ecosystem to consider and explore purposeful ways to drive change.

The speakers are, frankly, amazing — they’re innovators and speakers on technology but they are the people interested in the most critical global challenges caused by our historically incoherent business practices.

As you’d expect from the Requisite Agility space, these are big thinkers who have a lot of experience of taking action. (And this is driven partly out of [#india](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=india&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6931867429622996992) — the cradle of so much tech innovation, grappling with so many of the core problems of humanity’s future).

I can highly recommend it and many of these speakers are worth the entry price alone — and you can get 50% off using the discount code: CONF50
