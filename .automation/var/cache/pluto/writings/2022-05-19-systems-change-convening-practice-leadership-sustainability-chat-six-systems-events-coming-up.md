### systems change, convening, practice, leadership, sustainability, chat… SIX systems events coming up presented or facilitated by Benjamin Taylor

It me!

I haven’t presented or run that many public events recently, and suddenly they all come at once. Here are six in the next couple of months — with info and booking links:

**“Later in the bar”**  
_Mon 23 May 2022 18:30–20:00 UK time, SCiO_  
Informal, open systems practice chat  
**Book at:** [https://systemspractice.org/events/later-bar-scio-uk-may-2022](https://systemspractice.org/events/later-bar-scio-uk-may-2022) (free)

**Workshop: Systems thinking and systems convening for carbon capture change — facilitated workshop**  
_May 28, 2022 — part of the Systems Change Alliance online conference — Carbon Capture Deep Dive: A Systems Change Perspective_  
I am facilitating an introduction covering systems thinking and aspects of systems convening.  
**Book at:** [https://systemschangealliance.org/events-calendar/carbon-capture-deep-dive/?swcfpc=1](https://systemschangealliance.org/events-calendar/carbon-capture-deep-dive/?swcfpc=1) (paid, part of conference)

**The Viable Systems Model and human systems dynamics through the lens of Barry Oshry’s Organic Systems Model**  
_14th Metaphorum Conference, Leuven, Belgium, 10–12 June 2022_ NB I am still trying to confirm travel arrangements so I can attend this amazing conference.  
The VSM is undoubtedly about people in organisation, at heart, and I consider it to represent some of the most essential, fundamental aspects of organisation. But not all. Long before I encountered Beer’s work, I was engaged in studying Barry Oshry’s power+systems framework, now called the organic systems model. Developed from extended observation of experiential workshops, this framework identifies sensemaking ‘worlds’ — Top, Middle, Bottom, Customer, Helper, Dominant, Other — ‘real’ conditions which seem to inevitably pertain in different relationships to responsibility, authority, and decision-making — and instinctive human responses to those conditions, which both exacerbate the conditions and create problematic human dynamics within and between the worlds which persistently shift people out of partnership — a shared focus on what we collectively value.

**systems convening, systems thinking, and systems practice**  
_A session for the systems convening community — June 13, 2022 12:30–1:30pm UK time_  
What light do systems thinking and practice shed on systems convening? What can they add?  
**Book at:** [https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEudeGprD0vH9JKdOCaj7utfGUoM5AGVu-r](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEudeGprD0vH9JKdOCaj7utfGUoM5AGVu-r) (free)

**Workshop: Systems thinking and systems convening for carbon capture — advanced workshop**  
_June 14th 2–6pm UK time — the Systems Change Alliance_  
This workshop will work dynamically to deeped an understanding of what systems thinking can offer for the changes we are seeking.  
**Book at:** [https://systemschangealliance.org/events-calendar/systems-thinking-and-systems-convening-for-carbon-capture/](https://systemschangealliance.org/events-calendar/systems-thinking-and-systems-convening-for-carbon-capture/) (paid)

**Systems leadership, change, theory, and practice**  
_Mon 11 July 2022 18:30–20:30 UK time, SCiO Virtual Open Meeting — July 2022_  
Systems Leadership and Systems Change are very popular phrases at the moment — search the web for a sense (and sense Medium.com if you really want to boggle your mind).  
Some of it is really good, some of it is risible, and much has little to do with systems thinking or systems practice.  
This session will explore some of the existing territory and dimensions and sketch out Benjamin’s approach.  
Benjamin will draw on two of his articles from last year (but reading them isn’t necessary to attend): [https://i2insights.org/2021/06/22/systems-leadership/](https://i2insights.org/2021/06/22/systems-leadership/) and [https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/06/21/a-schema-for-better-understanding-systems-leadership-and-systems-change/](https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/06/21/a-schema-for-better-understanding-systems-leadership-and-systems-change/)  
**Book at:** [https://systemspractice.org/events/scio-virtual-open-meeting-july-2022](https://systemspractice.org/events/scio-virtual-open-meeting-july-2022) (free, two speaker event)
