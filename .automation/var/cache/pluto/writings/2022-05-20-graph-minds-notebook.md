This is the series home page for the Graph Minds series, which Iâ€™m writing in a sort of working-in-public notebook format.

**Prequels** : Articles that led up to this line of thought for me. They donâ€™t cleanly fit the overarching framework of this series, but prefigure many of the themes in messy ways. Read if interested, but not necessary for understanding the main series.
