Is the lesson ‘feel sorry for me, for I am afflicted (and possibly sorry for myself)?’ or ‘don’t feel sorry for me, for I am strong and self-reliant — but obviously \*especially\* strong and self-reliant because I have this extra special thing’ — or is it just a general … [Continue reading So.

#### [SCiO Virtual Open Meeting — 11 July 2022 Tickets, Mon 11 Jul 2022 at 18:30 | Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/scio-virtual-open-meeting-july-2022-tickets-344353860667?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

[www.eventbrite.co.uk](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/scio-virtual-open-meeting-july-2022-tickets-344353860667)   
 The programme for 11th July 2022 is as follows: 18:30 — Welcome, virtual housekeeping and check-in 18:40 — SCiO Introduction & Notices 18:45 — Session 1 (presentation and Q & A ) — When Unfreeze-Move-Refreeze Isn’t Working: Doing, Thinking and Making Via Systems Changes Learning — David Ing 19:40 — Session 2 (presentation and Q & A) — Systems Leadership & Change, Benjamin Taylor 20:30 — Summary and close 20:30–21:00 (Optional) — virtual networking ================================================= Session 1 — When Unfreeze-Move-Refreeze Isn’t Working: Doing, Thinking and Making Via Systems Changes Learning Abstract: Practitioners coming to the systems sciences and/or systems thinking have an interest in “systems change(s)”. Many come from premise that that change occurs as “unfreeze-move-refreeze”, misattributed to Kurt Lewin. A more reflective view of systems changes not only sees distinctions between the intended and emergent recognized by Henry Mintzberg, but also an ecological epistemology. That leads to an appreciation of living systems in a temporality of the landscape as described by Tim Ingold extending the tradition of Gregory Bateson. Beyond the metaphysics of Heraclitus and Parmenides, the sciences of systems can be extended through a philosophy of science underpinning Classical Chinese Medicine. The ontology of contextual-dyadic thinking outlined by Keekok Lee is in contrast to the Western dualistic thinking. For novices, the central concepts in the Systems Changes Learning approach are: (i) rhythmic shifts; (ii) texture; and (iii) propensity. Practices are depicted as a hub of “knowing from within”, and four axes of (i) recognizing contextural influences; (ii) diagnosing rhythmic disorders; (iii) prognosing likelihoods; and (iv) reordering pacing. In workshops, metaphors of (i) sun waxing and waning; (ii) musicians weaving into an ensemble; and (iii) motions riding a surfboard, have effectively reframed thinking about systems changes. Providing a workbook with guiding questions has aided self-organizing groups to surface their points of view and engage in rich discussion, with a minimal coaching by facilitators. Ongoing action learning on doing (praxis), thinking (episteme) and making (poiesis) by the Systems Changes Learning Circle is in year 4 of an espoused ten-year journey. Presenter: David Ing is past-president of the International Society for the Systems Sciences (2011–2012). He graduated from IBM after 28 years, with assignments in management consulting, industry solutions and headquarters planning. He blogs at [https://coevolving.com](https://coevolving.com) , and is a cofounder of [https://systemschanges.com.](https://systemschanges.com.) David resides in Toronto, Canada. ================================================= Session 2 — Systems Leadership & Change Abstract: Systems Leadership and Systems Change are very popular phrases at the moment — search the web for a sense (and Medium.com if you really want to boggle your mind). Some of it is really good, some of it is risible, and much has little to do with systems thinking or systems practice. This session will explore some of the existing territory and dimensions and sketch out Benjamin’s approach, drawing on two of his articles from last year (reading them isn’t necessary to attend): [https://i2insights.org/2021/06/22/systems-leadership/](https://i2insights.org/2021/06/22/systems-leadership/) and [https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/06/21/a-schema-for-better-understanding-systems-leadership-and-systems-change/](https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/06/21/a-schema-for-better-understanding-systems-leadership-and-systems-change/) Presenter: Benjamin Taylor: Benjamin is on the SCiO board, a Fellow of the Cybernetics Society, and works on ‘systems change’ and stuff in public services. He runs RedQuadrant — offering the RedQuadrant tool shed to share methods and practices — and the Public Service Transformation Academy.

 “Later in the bar” is a SCiO UK networking event where we try to recapture some of the features of meeting in the bar after an open meeting. This is an opportunity to mingle freely (online) and set your own agenda. These social networking events are different from the open days (speakers and discussion) and member-only development days (each agenda slot filled set by members for learning discussions).
