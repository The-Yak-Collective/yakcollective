I was recently interviewed on the Amble Podcast about foresight games - [go listen](https://amble.studio/episode-11-foresight-games-with-randy-lubin/) (or read the transcript)!

The Amble crew is wonderful and Hailey and Jason are amazing podcast hosts. The conversation covered a lot of ground, including:

- Examples of foresight games
- How to make the games approachable, safe, and productive for the players
- How to include models in the games
- How to design using a stagegate approach
- â€¦and much more!
