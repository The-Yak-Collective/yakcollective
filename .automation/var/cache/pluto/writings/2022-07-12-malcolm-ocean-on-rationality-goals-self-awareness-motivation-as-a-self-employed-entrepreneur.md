Malcolm ocean is a fellow wanderer of the pathless path and as is such â€“ is hard to describe. He runs a software company, Complice which helps people turn big goals into day-to-day actions. More broadly from my vantage point, Malcolm appears to be one of the most deeply curious humans alive about how we make things happen at the individual and group levels.

**Just published!** The Pathless Path is Paul's book about walking away from a "perfect" job with a promising future and starting over again. Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.
