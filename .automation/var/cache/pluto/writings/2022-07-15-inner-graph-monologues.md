One of the nice things about keeping a big curiosity active over a long time is you get sensitized to interesting provocations in the wild (aka Twitter) that move the thinking along with low effort. This is why I like to marinate my thinking in the Twitter scene by sharing bits and pieces of what I’m reading and thinking about.

An interesting recent provocation of this kind was a [tweet](https://twitter.com/mutual_ayyde/status/1546264719077412864) to which I responded with a shitpost, which immediately struck me as a significant clue for our graph mind investigations:

The notion of the _New York Times_ being the inner monologue of the Acela corridor is a good illustration of the concept I want to explore today — inner monologues for graph minds, or _inner graph monologues._ I am using that ordering, rather than _graph inner monologue,_ because it isn’t just a graph mind’s inner monologue, but one that happens in the _interior_ of the graph mind, in the “inner graph.”

You have to be immersed in the interior to “hear” it. You can’t hear it from the outside.
