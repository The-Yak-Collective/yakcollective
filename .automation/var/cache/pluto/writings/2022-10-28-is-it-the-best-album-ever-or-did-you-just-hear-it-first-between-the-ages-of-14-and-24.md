Does ‘nobody want to work anymore’ or has that been a trope since at least the start of the 20th Century? Is everyone losing their sense of humour — or did they just move on?

Are your children experimenting with fundamental dangerous drugs, music, politics, and social mores — or did you forget they’re ‘beyond your command’?

Are the ‘franchise properties’ of your childhood being \*absolutely traduced\* in that new, disgustingly ‘woke’ movie which is going to poison the well forever and \*completely misunderstands\* the \*entire basis\* of the canon… or are the commercial owners of the franchise just looking for a new audience?

Does your favourite sitcom feel a little bit uncomfortable now?

Are they really going too far, this time?

### In short¸ are policemen — sorry, police officers — getting younger these days, or are you just getting older?

In the 1992 art-flick ‘Another Girl, Another Planet’ by Michael Almereyda, a rich man hires a Tibetan Lama to sit with him while he’s dying. After the body dies, the brain keeps going for a few seconds, and hearing still works. The lama leans over and very clearly and loudly says in his ear ‘you’re dead, Frank!’
