A lot has happened in the two weeks since I wrote the first part of this article, [The Muskening](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-muskening). Things have moved much faster than I anticipated, and matters I expected would become clear over months became clear within weeks. My own decisions, which I’ll share, have been rendered much easier as a result, and I’ve been able to make them sooner. This has surprised some people, but I tend not to stick around once I can read the writing on a wall, and decide I don’t like the message. Life is too short to fight joyless rearguard battles on aging frontiers when there are exciting pioneer adventures to be had on emerging ones.

A brief summary of where we left off. Two weeks ago, I concluded that the encounter between Twitter and Musk was like an immovable object meeting an irresistible force; an undefeated emperor meeting a fabled graveyard of empires. The result was both sides getting into each other’s OODA loops and knocking each other out simultaneously, leading to a series of own-goals on both sides.

We mostly covered the Musk-side drama last time, so I’ll do an update on the state of play there, before turning our attention to the other side of the drama: the responses (which I assessed to be 95% ineffective last time), on the user side. I’ll share my assessment of what I think is going on there, why I think it is ineffective, what I’m doing instead, and what I think at least _some_ of you should do as well.

We’ll wrap up this 2-parter with a brief look at the broader questions, which go beyond Twitter, and even beyond the [Silicon Valley vibe shift](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/silicon-valley-vibe-shift), precipitated by the Muskening. As an isolated battle over one social media platform, the Muskening is important, but not _that_ important.

But as an early sign of more momentous shifts, it is much more important, and it’s that level of significance I want to get to.
