In this series, I hope to lay some groundwork for a converged, unified theory of the four great frontiers of computing today: AI, crypto, robotics, and the metaverse. I call this converged theory _mediocre_ computing, for reasons that will become clear if you read the first two essays. I have retconned a bunch of older essays, both on this newsletter and on the Ribbonfarm blog, into this series.

A companion series, [Graph Minds Notebook](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/graph-minds-notebook), deals with mixed human-computer ‚Äúhive mind‚Äù type systems.
