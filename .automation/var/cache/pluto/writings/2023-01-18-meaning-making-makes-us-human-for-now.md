Hello friends,

Announcements first! Links to some new (and not-so-new) writing after.

## Announcements

1. **[I‚Äôm running a monthly discussion series about not-knowing.](https://vaughntan.org/notknowing)** It starts tomorrow (Thu, 19 Jan 2023, 2000-2200h CET) and runs every third Thursday for 14 sessions. This is a series of discussions, **not** a series of lectures. I have a point of view about not-knowing but I‚Äôm still thinking through what not-knowing is, who it is relevant to, and what can be done about it. I want my ideas challenged! If you‚Äôre thinking about this stuff too ‚Äî as an engineer, an artist, a policymaker, a leader, a student, an entrepreneur, an investor, or whatever ‚Äî please think about joining us.

2. I‚Äôm planning some changes to this newsletter:

## Recent (and not-so-recent) writing

1. **[What makes us human (for now)?](https://vaughntan.org/what-makes-us-human-for-now)** Lots of people are getting very excited that we are on the cusp of achieving human-level intelligence in machines, because Large Language Models can now produce output that convincingly imitates what a human could do. Viewing the ability to imitate another human as the indicator of human-ness in intelligence is both kinda silly and disturbing. Human-ness changes (and should change) over time. What humans can do right now which machines cannot, is make and confer meaning. When machines become sophisticated enough to make meaning too, we‚Äôll have to rethink human-ness. (18 Jan 2023)

2. **[Noma‚Äôs imminent closure, and what it shows us about the dilemmas of continual innovation.](https://theconversation.com/noma-to-close-why-its-so-hard-to-run-a-sustainable-innovation-focused-restaurant-197733)** The food world was briefly excited by Noma‚Äôs announcement that it would close as an innovation-focused restaurant to work solely on culinary innovation and new product development. This transformation makes sense (el Bulli did it over a decade ago): Restaurants need consistency and efficiency to survive, and continual innovation is the enemy of consistency and efficiency. (13 Jan 2023)

3. **[Learning from leaving the city.](https://www.mrporter.com/en-fr/journal/lifestyle/how-i-left-the-city-vaughn-tan-london-france-10715414)** Being in a place where nothing much happens and there are almost no people makes it easier to notice small, otherwise imperceptible things about yourself and the environment you are in.
