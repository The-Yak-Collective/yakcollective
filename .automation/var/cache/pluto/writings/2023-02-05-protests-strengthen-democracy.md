When I read about [Russia’s role in the Canadian convoy protests](https://newsie.social/@rvawonk/109806982624412320) , I immediately thought of Roman concrete. Let me explain.

This week, behavioral scientist Caroline Orr Bueno released a paper on Russia’s role in the Canadian convoy protests. Her [summary](https://newsie.social/@rvawonk/109806982624412320) and [full paper](https://journals.lib.sfu.ca/index.php/jicw/article/view/5101) are worth reading but TLDR: **Russia amplifies existing dissent in democratic countries to destabilize them.**

In other news, scientists have finally [figured out](https://news.mit.edu/2023/roman-concrete-durability-lime-casts-0106) why ancient Roman concrete is so much stronger than modern concrete. The Romans knew that concrete would crack over time, so they added a brittle form of lime that reacts with water to reform. These “lime clasts” break first under pressure then quickly recrystallize, creating “self-healing concrete”.[1](#fn:1)

To an authoritarian regime, public dissent is always a risk. When the public cannot disapprove “safely”, there is only revolution left. From that perspective, it benefits Russia to support protests in others countries. However, in a healthy democracy, public demonstrations are lime clasts, not dynamite. **Just as lime reacts with water to strengthen concrete, the public reacts with its representatives to strengthen democracy.**

That said…is our democracy healthy? Is our lime crystallizing or crumbling? In the United States at least, I can’t tell.
