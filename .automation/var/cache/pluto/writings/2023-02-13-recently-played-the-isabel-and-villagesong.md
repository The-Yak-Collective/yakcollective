This weekend, I played two new storytelling games with Raph and Nick and had a great time! Both are card driven games that effectively use prompts to support a specific type of storytelling.

First up was [The Isabel](https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/desperation), a new game by Jason Morningstar, where we told the tale of a doomed cod fishing expedition. The game had a nice mechanic where we would draw an action and then decide which character carried it out, which worked well. The prompts were all evocative and it was fun to match them to characters.

Second up was [Villagesong](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/villagesong/), by Vee Hendro, in which we explored three villages and their leaders as they grappled with change and tensions. The setup and prompts guided us through a satisfying arc about the island coming together.
