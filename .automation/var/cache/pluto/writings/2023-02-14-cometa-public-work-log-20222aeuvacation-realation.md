### Coεmeta Public Work Log 2022.2.AEU — Vacation & Re(a)lation

#### Autumnal Equinox Update (9/22/2022): rest, real relation, realignment, recalibration

> _This is the third_ [_Public Work Log_](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) _entry for_ [_Coεmeta_](https://coemeta.xyz/)_, a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It’s intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of_ [_working in public_](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)_, contributing to_ [_knowledge commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)_, “finding the others” & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to_ [_reach out_](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) _at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!_

_- Daniel McNichol_, founder & Chief Scientist

_This post is a belated excerpt of the full versions available at:_ [**_Github_**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.2.aeu.md) _(primary source & version control) &_ [**_Roam_**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/J7l1V6V0J) _(navigable outline format)_

- _comments, forks & pull requests are welcome!_

_It complements our_ [_Open Source Strategy repo_](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_, which offers more discrete, version-controlled resources related to the strategies & frameworks discussed here in more narrative form._

### 📜 Prologue: backstory & antecedents

#### Backstory

_Coεmeta_ is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):

> a more **balanced, integrated, enriching & impactful** life in **greater community**

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka “infinitely”), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

> (My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a [worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) or [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & partnerships with other “self-sovereign” _ᵋ_ groups or entities. This is part of the “in greater community” aspect of the metagame.)

So Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional ‘venture’ or typical small business or startup etc, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [previous log entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of the first two entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)

ᵋ NB: I’m generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized “[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)”, but “independent” isn’t quite adequate either.

#### Antecedents & adumbration

In the [**previous entry**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/mkxDLqzZy), I [**reported**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/HpCoT2_1P) **good vibes & gratitude** for progress towards a **more outward focus & mutual capacity-building** , & **new opportunities** (once again) thanks to luck & the kindness of others.

I also discussed how **some prior balance gave way to seizing those opportunities** , & noted **looming risks & shadows** , some of which have grown closer & longer. But I also **looked forward to continued cultivation & harvest** , & wrestling with ideas of **further scaling (or sporing)** these efforts for **greater impact & a greater common good**.

The intervening 3 months mostly revolved around late summer **vacations & more real-world engagement** , + _preparing for_ & _recovering from_ those things. All of that, alongside a **full plate of client workloads** , left **little time for other** [**pillar**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md) **work: public toolmaking & content creation**. So this entry is shorter & less substantive than the others: I’ve done much less public work (& frankly, less private work on internal business stuff as well).

### ⏳ Timeline

**Jul-Sep 2022**

- Mostly a **blur of vacations, tending to real-world relations, & recovering & recalibrating**

- **Prioritize client work with remaining attention & energy** , while **maintaining** previously established **mutual-capacity building efforts** via ‘[crewing](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/NWZYhuTL-)’, [mentorship & apprenticeship](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/Uh2vULaFP)
- **Also workshop & refine Coεmeta** [**mission & vision**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md) **&** [**website**](https://coemeta.com) **verbiage** , to better reflect evolving strategic priorities & aspirations
- **Celebrated client successes & milestones** , such as [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)’s [Stronger Democracy Award](https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2022/07/06/investing-in-a-civic-media-movement) & [Documenters.org](https://www.documenters.org) program expansion plans, & [The Baltimore Banner](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com)’s successful launch & initial strides towards their [public interest mission](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/about/)

### ꩜ Coda: eval & checkout

#### Eval

My [still-provisional](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/xjORMILAl) **metrics** tracking framework [again](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/Fg1AHf06j) **tells the story pretty clearly** :

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KuGNPTFUUHoDbNsL)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*M442EJjMEPa89sJC)

- **_Freelance client work drowned out all other efforts_** _, while_ **_overall effort declined_** _due to (much needed) summer vacations etc_

Predictably, as in [Q2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdBfK9FYPXAVAoHKcvjufuq5_6Hso2KmdGZGU8ChG8g/edit?usp=sharing), my [Q3 OKRs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17A9nv2-wEIH5hiiCrrNYSSmv6eFlKlLDqBKcdoIErQg/edit?usp=sharing) reflect the same imbalances described above. But revenue-related & [outcome](https://www.perdoo.com/resources/outcomes-vs-outputs/)-focused results were bright spots:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ENsIfbt2-dPCO_ZU)

And again, some of these will roll over to next quarter, where I hope to not only rebalance across the longer [time-average](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/ViMjefBqd), but also recalibrate my overall objectives ahead of year two of the Coεmeta journey

#### Vibe Check

And on to what really matters: the vibe check…

- **I feel great** , & **more alive** to the world than I have in a while. (albeit more the world of _atoms_ than _bits_)

The [**balance**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/G9ZmRPEjC) of the early months (& the [metagame](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/w67o_tL55)) **remains elusive** , & [**shadows**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/V_9gJ5XEs) **still loom**. But I’m **deeply grateful for the good fortune & generosity** I’ve experienced so far, & for the **opportunities to share the harvest** & reinvest in mutual capacity-building. I’ll continue to grapple with these opportunities, & the challenges of scaling impact & rebalancing my efforts, while revisiting & reaffirming [the mission](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md) for this next cycle.
