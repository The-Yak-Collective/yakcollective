### Coεmeta Public Work Log 2022.3.WSU — Cycle Completion

#### Winter Solstice Update (12/21/2022): good problems & the first cycle complete

> _This is the_ fourth [_Public Work Log_](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) _entry for_ [_Coεmeta_](https://coemeta.xyz/)_, a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It’s intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of_ [_working in public_](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)_, contributing to_ [_knowledge commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)_, “finding the others” & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to_ [_reach out_](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) _at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!_

_- Daniel McNichol_, founder & Chief Scientist

_This post is a belated mirror of the versions available at:_ [**_Github_**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.3.wsu.md) _(primary source & version control) &_ [**_Roam_**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/hb9LkLT8f) _(navigable outline format)_

- _comments, forks & pull requests are welcome!_

_It complements our_ [_Open Source Strategy repo_](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_, which offers more discrete, version-controlled resources related to the strategies & frameworks discussed here in more narrative form._

> **This update is entirely in TL;DR form** , due to bandwidth & capacity constraints. (which itself perhaps speaks volumes…but a few additional details below).

### 📜 Prologue & Epilogue ♻️: a TL;DR

A **full year has passed** since embarking on this journey, the first full cycle complete.

- **Predictably, things didn’t go quite as predicted** : I expected to test & learn on several fronts, but never got to test some theories, & instead learned things I didn’t expect.
- **All told, things went better than I could have hoped** on the most fundamental “bottom-line” matters, mostly due to the kindness & generosity of others — for which I’m tremendously grateful & fortunate.
- **But vital** [**pillars**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md) **of the broader** [**mission**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md) **went largely neglected** as a consequence, & **the** [**vision itself evolved**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/ywwA0T9W4) (as expected) in response to experience gained & lessons learned.

Regarding the **initial** [**pillars**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md), a **brief assessment** :

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CHDQ9boaGKPfEctI)

- **freelance** : _far too much_
- **relation** : _adequate_
- **content** : _very little_
- **public toolmaking** : _very little_

**The** [**center / bottom-right quadrants of the mutant 2x2**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md#--strategic-pillar-2x2s--certainty-vs-scalability--feedback-loops--interdependencies) **got the lion’s share of effort & attention** , which generally validated at least those portions of the model. A few notable observations:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QCPM_RRUY--BicyX)

- **I’m naturally inclined towards high signal / low noise channels** anyway, so when opportunities arose there I pursued them, for both **tactical & dispositional reasons**.
- **Freelance client work turned out,** [**as expected**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md#--strategic-pillar-2x2s--certainty-vs-scalability--feedback-loops--interdependencies) **, to be high-certainty & low-scalability** : low risk/reward ratio, little chance of asymmetric payoffs.
- **— So this part “worked”** , & has its place in the portfolio, **but I over-indexed** , & at times felt like I never left FTE life. (which was ….not the plan
- So **I played the hand that was dealt, exploring opportunities & also mitigating looming risks** (recession, etc), but was also able to **leverage excess client demand to further build partnerships & relationships** of exchange & mutual support — which was also always a critical piece of the mission.
- — But this was again in **high signal / small scale** scenarios (a la [microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) & [squad wealth](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/), which remain inspirations).
- And the more **Public Work pillars of content & tool creation were crowded out** , but I did feel good about **supporting the public work of clients** : from [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)’s [tremendous program expansion](https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2022/07/06/investing-in-a-civic-media-movement) to [The Baltimore Banner](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com)’s launch, to a new engagement with a local Public Broadcasting network.
- — In fact this contributed to the aforementioned [evolution & refinement of the mision itself](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/ywwA0T9W4): as a **lever for impact**

So **I feel deeply gratified & substantially validated** in my initial motivations & conception of this endeavor. And yet, **not fully satisfied**. There’s still vital, fertile ground to explore. So **I’m excited for this new cycle, to continue wayfinding & course-correcting** : new plans, new ambitions, new directions, new journeys.

I’ll have more to say (& hopefully show) on this in a future update. But suffice to say that **the** [**metagame**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/w67o_tL55) **endures, & it’s best in multiplayer mode**.
