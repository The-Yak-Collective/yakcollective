### Coεmeta Public Work Log 2023.0.VEU — A New Cycle

#### Vernal Equinox Update (3/20/2023): Reboot, renewal & continuities

> _This is the fifth_ [_Public Work Log_](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) _entry for_ [_Coεmeta_](https://coemeta.xyz/)_, a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It’s intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of_ [_working in public_](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)_, contributing to_ [_knowledge commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)_, “finding the others” & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to_ [_reach out_](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) _at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!_

_It complements our_ [_Open Source Strategy repo_](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_, which offers more discrete, version-controlled resources related to the strategies & frameworks discussed here in more narrative form._

### 📜 Prologue: backstory & antecedents

### Backstory

_Coεmeta_ is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):

> _a more_ **_balanced, integrated, enriching & impactful_** _life in_ **_greater community_**

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka “infinitely”), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

> _(My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a_ [_worker-owned cooperative_](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) _or_ [_DAO_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) _with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of_ [_mutual aid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) _& partnerships with other “self-sovereign” ᵋ groups or entities. This is part of the “in greater community” aspect of the metagame.)_

So Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional ‘venture’ or typical small business or startup etc, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [previous log entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)

ᵋ NB: I’m generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized “[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)”, but “independent” isn’t quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration

This entry marks the 2nd _Vernal Equinox Update_, & the first [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log) of this new cycle. The [first VEU](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md) was also the first overall Public Work Log, & looking back now, it was remarkably substantive & eventful. This is largely due to the 6+ months of antecedents it included, but also the richness of those first few months on this path. I’ve now come full circle in multiple senses & am beginning to feel that richness germinate again, as described below.

In contrast, I wrote the [previous entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md) entirely in TL;DR format, due to bandwidth & capacity constraints resulting from an overload of client work (which [became](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#%E2%8F%B3-timeline) a [recurring](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md#eval) [theme](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.3.wsu.md#%F0%9F%93%9C-prologue--epilogue-%E2%99%BB%EF%B8%8F-a-tldr) throughout last cycle). I reflected on predictable unpredictability, untested theories & neglected pillars of the original mission over as my 1st year an independent worker.

I also conveyed gratitude & some validation of my initial motivations & conceptions, & yet lingering dissatisfaction over the aforementioned untested theories & neglected pillars. So in the new year I made the difficult decision to rebalance my workloads, which meant ending an engagement with a major client in order to refocus my energy & efforts where they felt most vital.

The past three months were largely consumed by that transition, turnover & recovery from the untenable imbalance. But by the end of it (at the time of writing), I’m feeling back on track, rejuvenated & redoubled in my conviction of this path.

### ⏳ Timeline

### ꩜ Coda: eval & checkout

### Eval

The numbers don’t add much to the story here, but for completeness & continuity with [past entries](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log):

_NB: my diligence re: non-billable time tracking also wavered a bit in the annotated client glut & burnout epochs, so everything but freelance is likely a bit understated_

_(annual targets are prorated / to-date)_

### Vibe Check

But how are the vibes?

> _Refreshed & renewed._ Ready for more.  
> …play started to become finite again, so had to reboot

I do feel a bit behind the curve of this new cycle, as the prior year spilled over & needed a cleanup. I’m only just rebooting now, 1/4 the way through. But I feel good about weaving those threads of continuity into the knotwork of this next cycle, yet more [strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop) in the [infinite game](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#backstory).
