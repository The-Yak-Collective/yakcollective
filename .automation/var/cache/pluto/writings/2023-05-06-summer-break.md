I am taking a summer break starting today. Regular programming will resume in mid-June.

For paying subscribers, billing will be paused until I hit the resume button. Your next bill date will be pushed out appropriately. If you have 12 days left on a monthly subscription right now, you’ll still have 12 days left when I resume. If you have 289 days left on an annual subscription, you’ll still have 289 days.

I wasn’t planning on a break, but what with running the [Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com), navigating a move back to the Seattle area in early June, and an upcoming intense phase on another client project, something had to give. Once I’m settled into my new place, I’ll pick up where we’ve left off on various threads.

You’ll still have access to the [archives](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) as usual of course, so you can catch up on stuff you might have missed.

**During this hiatus, it will not be possible to sign up for a paid subscription if you don’t already have one, so the paywalled archives will be unavailable to new readers.**
