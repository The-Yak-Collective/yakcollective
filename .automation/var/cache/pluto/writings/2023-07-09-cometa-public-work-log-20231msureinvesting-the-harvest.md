### Coεmeta Public Work Log 2023.1.MSU — Reinvesting the Harvest

#### Midsummer Solstice Update (6/21/2023): Strange loops & new knots

> _This is the sixth_ [_Public Work Log_](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) _entry for_ [_Coεmeta_](https://coemeta.xyz/)_, a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It’s intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of_ [_working in public_](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)_, contributing to_ [_knowledge commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)_, “finding the others” & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to_ [_reach out_](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) _at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!_

_- Daniel McNichol_, founder & Chief Scientist

_This post is an excerpt of the full versions available at:_ [**_Github_**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md) _(primary source & version control) &_ [**_Roam_**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/QqIlUcMjN)_(navigable outline format)_

- _comments, forks & pull requests are welcome!_

_It complements our_ [_Open Source Strategy repo_](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_, which offers more discrete, version-controlled resources related to the strategies & frameworks discussed here in more narrative form._

### 📜 Prologue: backstory & antecedents

### Backstory

_Coεmeta_ is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):

> _a more_ **_balanced, integrated, enriching & impactful_** _life in_ **_greater community_**

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka “infinitely”), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

> _(My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a_ [_worker-owned cooperative_](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) _or_ [_DAO_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) _with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of_ [_mutual aid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) _& partnerships with other “self-sovereign” ᵋ groups or entities. This is part of the “in greater community” aspect of the metagame.)_

So Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional ‘venture’ or typical small business or startup etc, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [previous log entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)

ᵋ NB: I’m generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized “[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)”, but “independent” isn’t quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration

This is the 2nd cycle of [Public Work Logs](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log), & the 2nd Midsummer Solstice Update. Last [midsummer update](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md) I was [shifting to a more outward focus](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) & emerging from [long-sought](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) balance to seize new opportunities (which would ultimately vanquish all balance until well into this year). That dynamic [persisted](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) until [last update](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md), where I described [difficult decisions](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) needed to rebalance, refocus & recover — eventually feeling rejuvenated enough to [revisit + recommit to neglected pillars of the original mission](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-timeline).

Since then, I’ve gone a bit …off script: got an apartment-sitter for the summer, bought a used electric car, set out on an indefinite car-life adventure to visit friends & family & play in the woods, etc. Also eventually got back around to the whole neglected pillars thing.

### ⏳ Timeline

#### (This content is too long to navigate without the ability to collapse & expand sections, so see the full version on [Github](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md) or [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/QqIlUcMjN))

### ꩜ Coda: eval & checkout

### Eval

And again for [continuity](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-coda-eval--checkout) if nothing else, the numbers tell a thin, reductive version of the story:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hQRJycxGEmVmPf8U.png)

- the [workload rebalancing](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) across the pillars is apparent here, as is the June impact of [forrest / mountain life](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-timeline)
- (this rebalancing & resource reallocation also reflects progress towards my nascent [8 capital strategy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.0.veu/8-capital-strategy-draft.png))
- NB also: I’m still struggling a bit to be at ease with [hyperopic balance](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-timeline), still some psychic hangups & lingering feelings I should be doing more conventional “work” at most times. So having frameworks & rituals like this to zoom out & recalibrate has been invaluable.

_(targets are not prorated …still lacking in tool & content output…but finally working on it)_

… & a glance at the [recently rebooted OKRs](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-timeline) for completeness:

### Vibe Check

& as for the vibes:

> _Immaculate as ever_  
> …the path feels truer by the day, & my gratitude & appreciation grows in turn

I’m consciously cashing in on lifestyle credit accrued during [last cycle’s overload & burnout](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.0.veu.md#-coda-eval--checkout), & know that [hyperopic rebalancing](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-timeline) will come calling again. And I’m here for it. This is the way of the [infinite game](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2023.1.msu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents).
