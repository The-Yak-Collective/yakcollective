**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

Fish in a Tie, founded by Peter Illic and later run by the charming couple Lili and Marco, was a legendary restaurant in my life. Known for its European cuisine and affordable prices, it was a community hub for celebrations and gatherings. Sadly, it succumbed to the challenges of the pandemic in 2020, leaving behind cherished memories and a legacy of hospitality. I regret not knowing sooner, as their food deliveries would have brought comfort during lockdown. Fish in a Tie embodies the ideals of running a business with grace, authenticity, and generosity, leaving a lasting impression in my personal story.

[Concentration — Geo. W. Walker (1896)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/09/03/concentration-geo-w-walker-1896/)

> Matthew Shapiro

> In the Ecology of Systems Thinking group says:

> Since systems thinking in education is a common topic in this group (and perhaps its cousin or sister interdisciplinary thinking is welcome as well), I thought to post this little article from 1896, which describes one way to approach it. The following is the introduction. “Concentration , or the correlation of studies, is only the extension of the principle of the relativity of knowledge which has been current in the world since the rise of a philosophy of the sciences. The assumption of the relativity of knowledge is denial that knowledge is absolute At the same time it is an assertion that each province of knowledge is related to all others, that all the departments of human knowledge form one articulated body of which the various branches of learning form mutually dependent parts.”

Join us on Saturday, September 30th, as we celebrate the publication of _Combining_, the latest book by Institute of General Semantics Trustee **Nora Bateson**. The New York Society for General Semantics is pleased to host a reading and book signing with the author during her brief visit to New York City. The event is cosponsored by the Institute of General Semantics.

In _Combining_ Nora Bateson invites us into an ecology of communication where nothing stands alone, and every action sets off incalculable consequences. She challenges conventional fixes for our problems, highlighting the need to tackle issues at multiple levels, understand interdependence, and embrace ambiguity.

Insisting on our collective responsibility to confront the looming threats to humanity’s survival, she advocates change through interdependencies and challenges us to rethink our perspectives on relationships, community, and the very essence of being human.

A blend of intellectual inquiry, essays, emotional engagement, storytelling, poetry and graphic art, _Combining_ is an invitation to nurture genuine connections and navigate a world brimming with “Warm Data” — the interrelationships that integrate elements of every complex system. The book calls on us to shed our linear thinking and embrace “Aphanipoiesis” — the unseen ways in which life comes together to foster vitality and propel evolution.

In _Combining_, love, humor, curiosity, and vulnerability entwine amidst the trials of a world in flux. As we face the Polycrisis, Nora Bateson urges us to swerve from the traditional paths and to dismantle the illusions of fitting in. She beckons us to step into a world where learning, uncutness, and readiness converge, promising both revelation and revolution.

**Nora Bateson** is an award-winning filmmaker, artist, international lecturer, research designer, author, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute. She is the founder and creator of Warm Data and the practices of the Warm Data Lab and People Need People Online.

Nora wrote, directed, and produced the documentary, _An Ecology of Mind_, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. Her book, _Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ published by Triarchy Press, UK, 2016 is a revolutionary personal approach to the study of systems and complexity.

Come join us for an inspiring and illuminating evening!

6 PM to 9 PM Saturday, September 30th at the historic [Players Club](http://www.theplayersnyc.org/) in Gramercy Park.

Registration is free, but **all attendees must be registered** in order to gain admittance to the club. This includes any guests you might want to bring with you.

A Systems Theory of Marginalization and its Implications for Systemic Intervention: In this talk, Gerald Midgley will present the systems theory of marginalization that he has been developing and applying in systemic interventions for almost 30 years. This theory offers a generic model of marginalization processes that is equally relevant to relationships between people in small groups, organizations, communities and international relations. Both people and the issues that concern them can become marginalized. Gerald will share several strategies for challenging marginalization when it has negative consequences. However, some of these strategies have a dark side that needs to be acknowledged if our projects are not to have unforeseen side-effects. The theory will be extensively illustrated with practical examples of projects from the UK and New Zealand.
