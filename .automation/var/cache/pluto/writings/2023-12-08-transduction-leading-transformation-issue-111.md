This week:

- Commissioning Academies
- Systems Thinking
- Systems and Complexity in Organisation
- Civil Service

Upcoming events:

**Two new commissioning academies: coming this winter!**

Exciting News! Introducing two Commissioning Academies.

- We will be offering a new  **Virtual Commissioning Academy** , launching in October, facilitated entirely online
- and an  **In-Person Commissioning Academy**  launching in January, with in-person sessions held in Nottingham.

Both offer the same great content, accredited by the PSTA and Cabinet Office.

Join our flagship development program to transform outcomes for the communities we serve!

- Be part of a national network of commissioning practitioners.
- Learn to initiate and lead change across complex systems.
- Develop capabilities to drive real transformation.
- Access expert insights and collaborative learning.
- Apply innovative ideas and approaches to your work.

Here’s what’s in store for you at the National Commissioning Academy:

- Foundation concepts: Working as a system, outcomes thinking, collaborative working.
- Commissioning for outcomes as a system: Systems thinking, asset-based commissioning, trauma-informed practice, prevention and early intervention.
- Creating conditions for change: Systems leadership, coproduction, innovation, and promoting social value.

Expect a transformative experience with masterclass workshops, action learning, expert speakers, peer challenges, practical action planning, and membership in our nationwide alumni community.

Ready to make a difference? Apply now to secure your spot at the Academy! Contact David Mason at [david.mason@publicservicetransformation.org](mailto:david.mason@publicservicetransformation.org)

**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

Addressing the leadership challenge of merging disparate groups, I advocate for six steps based on the Center for Creative Leadership’s insights. Initially, I emphasize maintaining comfort in individual identities by reinforcing boundaries and fostering understanding between groups. Gradually, I propose creating temporary collaborative spaces and forming new teams to implement shared goals. This process evolves into establishing permanent joint spaces, fostering cross-functional teams, and ultimately redefining collective identity. Drawing on systems thinking and models like the ‘four dynamics,’ these steps aim to open up, loosen, and transform identities in the context of innovation, change management, and digital transformation.

Gerald Midgely says:

SAD NEWS  
Many of you will know Pam Sydelko, who was a member of the ISSS and graduated with her PhD from our Centre for Systems Studies at the University of Hull in July 2023.  
I’m sad to report that she passed away recently, surrounded by her family, following a three-month illness.  
I am taking the liberty of sharing links to two open access (free to download) papers in the European Journal of Operational Research that Pam wrote out of her PhD, which are a legacy of her contribution. One of them has a 2024 date, so will be a posthumous publication, and I’m glad that Pam saw it accepted while she was still with us. Both papers are picking up citations at a healthy rate, so I am optimistic that Pam’s influence will continue with us for a good while.

[I was lucky enough to know Lucy, and marginally work with her through her partnership with Patrick Hoverstadt and involvement with SCiO. My comments, though, probably belong in their existing place as responses to this LinkedIn post from her long-time business partner (and great friend) Patrick Hoverstadt. I think this serves as an excellent obituary, including all the comments, responses, and reshares. If you wish to add your comments, I suggest you respond there].

Patrick Hoverstadt:

> _Sad to have to share that my long term business partner Lucy Loh died last week. I worked with Lucy for around 11 years, she wasn’t just very, very smart, creative – making substantial advances in several fields she worked in, she was kind, thoughtful, immensely hard working and professional, but she was also great fun to work with as several clients and colleagues have attested. Sadly, Lucy also had appalling luck health-wise with a series of accidents and spinal problems that left her in permanent pain and in a wheelchair for the last 5 years. Her overriding characteristic was I think the courage with which she faced her challenges and still managed to work both harder and smarter than pretty much anyone else I know. She will be greatly missed by family, friends, colleagues and clients. It was a privilege to know her for as long as I did._

[Councils across the country find themselves in a turbulent financial position.](https://mastodon.social/@antlerboy/111529198927978673) Since 2021 five local authorities have declared themselves effectively bankrupt, with a raft of councils warning they may have to do the same. Exclusive polling of English councillors by New Statesman Spotlight revealed that a quarter of councillors believe their council will soon go bankrupt.
