**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

Navigating partnerships is no cakewalk; it’s a journey through a minefield of productive conflict, where the magic truly happens. Picture climbers tethered on a cliff—effective communication is their lifeline. The allure is to stay in the ‘safe’ zone of agreement, but that can lead to uncontrolled explosions. Thriving in the productive conflict zone is key. Vision isn’t about idealistic notions; it’s crafting a shared mission grounded in reality, leveraging diverse perspectives for innovation. Opportunities lie in planting orchards, not picking low-hanging fruit. Facing problems head-on is crucial; dodging them only amplifies the alarm. Relationships form the bedrock, requiring productive learning over platitudes. In the productive conflict zone, ideas clash, but egos don’t, birthing innovation and forging powerful partnerships. Let’s embrace challenging conversations for stronger collaborations—redefining partnership as a propelling force, not just a buzzword. Productive, not merely productive-looking—because talking better leads to working better together.

[Partnerships in the ‘safe zone’ are the least productive and the most at risk of exploding in conflict. Do you recognise this dynamic?](https://chosen-path.org/2023/12/12/partnerships-in-the-safe-zone-are-the-least-productive-and-the-most-at-risk-of-exploding-in-conflict-do-you-recognise-this-dynamic/)

[Otto Laske: Celebrating Books and Film – 21 Dec 2023 18:00CET, online, free](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/12/12/otto-laske-celebrating-books-and-film-21-dec-2023-1800cet-online-free/)

We cordially invite you to join us in celebrating the launch of Otto Laske’s groundbreaking **three-volume book series**  titled  **“Advanced Systems-Level Problem Solving”**. This series delves into the practice of advanced, ‘dialectical’ systems-level problem-solving in both the social and natural sciences.

- Volume 1, “Approaching Real-World Complexity with Dialectical Thinking,” introduces the theoretical foundation for dialectical systems analysis, offering crucial insights into understanding physical systems under threat due to the climate crisis; [link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-40332-3)
- Volume 2, “How to Measure and Boost Thought Maturity,” focuses on the nature of work and uncovers the intricate structure of complex thinking; [link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-40985-1)
- Volume 3, “Manual of Dialectical Thought Forms,” is a unique resource offering practical guidance on applying dialectical thinking in real-world scenarios; [link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-40339-2)

In addition, we will also highlight the release of a documentary  **film “Forging a Life** ,” which explores the extraordinary life and lasting legacy of Otto Laske.  
Through Otto’s own reflections and experiences, audiences are invited to witness the transformative power of creativity and intellectual pursuits. His dedication to pushing the boundaries of knowledge serves as an inspiration to all who aspire to make a difference in their chosen fields. This film is not simply a documentary but rather an exploration of the human spirit and its capacity for growth and self-expression. It serves as a reminder that a life well-lived is one that embraces curiosity, creativity, and the pursuit of knowledge.
