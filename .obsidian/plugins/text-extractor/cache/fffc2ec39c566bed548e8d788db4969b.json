The New Old Home takes a look at some of the converging trends shaping homes in the post-COVID world as we partially return to an older way of doing things, but in new ways that integrate the lessons we’ve learned. Although the ideal of the modern post-war home has been in terminal decline for decades, it wasn’t clear what would come next. Now, COVID-19 is forcing the issue. Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com What is the New Old Home? Work used to take place in the home. Then it traveled out into the world with the male breadwinner. Now work has come back home again… but obviously things are now much different than they were on the farm. The New Old Home contains more breadwinners, and fewer children, than the Baby Boomer home. It hosts high levels of production, not just consumption. How will knowledge workers adapt themselves and their spaces to this new milieu? Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com Post-COVID Homes: The New Old Home The Radical New Home Intentional Groups, Cyberpunk Houses, High-end microapartments The Precarious Home Housepoor Buyers, Mobile Homes, Public Housing The Crash Pad Home AirBnB Nomads, Chronic Subletters ABOVE THE API BELOW THE API CONSERVATIVE RADICAL a small caveat... This goal of this deck is to imagine a \"model home\" that takes into account changing technologies, remote knowledge work, social/isolation needs, and care tasks. Model homes are slightly-aspirational visions for the middle class: a backyard with a white picket fence in the suburbs, a fancy condo in the city. In reality, homes come in a variety of shapes and sizes that can fall quite short of our aspirations. In particular, the future homes of the marginalized working class are not fully explored in this document. Nevertheless, we hope that some of the ideas in this deck are relevant to everyone as we look forward towards the future of our living spaces. “Lodgers in a Crowded Bayard Street Tenement—'Five Cents a Spot'”, from Jacob Riis photo collection of New York City (ca 1890) Drew Schorno drewschorno.com Clown school graduate.

Lenses on the New Old Home The Yak Collective7 | The Home as Farcaster Mansion In Dan Simmons’s 1989 science ﬁction classic, Hyperion, wealthy individuals such as the poet Martin Silenius own mansions constructed with “farcaster” technology, with different rooms or wings on different planets. Doorways between rooms are portals connecting worlds light years apart. Farcaster mansions suggest an allegorical understanding of a home as a portal among a set of otherwise disconnected worlds, with a presence in each, and comprising liminal passages between worlds for inhabitants to pass through. Individuals change roles and personas to suit different worlds, as they pass from room to room. Venkatesh Rao venkateshrao.com Previously at Xerox  (Illustration by Ryan Hume)  The Yak Collective8 | The Home as Farcaster Mansion Farcaster mansions serve as an illuminating allegory for the postmodern, post-Covid home as a set of portals among four different human worlds: 1.The supply chain world 2.The waste stream world 3.The domestic production world 4.The public appearances world These four universes can be arranged in an interesting 2x2, with inputs vs. outputs on the x-axis and high to low visibility on the y-axis. The farcaster mansion serves as an update and expansion of Thorstein Veblen’s conceptualization of the leisure class in terms of conspicuous consumption. Venkatesh Rao venkateshrao.com Previously at Xerox  (Illustration by Ryan Hume)  Domestic Production World Waste Stream World Supply Chain World Public Appearances World LOW VISIBILITY HIGH VISIBILITY INPUTS OUTPUTS The Yak Collective9 | The Home as Farcaster Mansion Venkatesh Rao venkateshrao.com Previously at Xerox  (Illustration by Ryan Hume)  What can be made at home in the most from-scratch way in a world where supplies can be uncertain and self-sufﬁciency is a higher imperative? What is the last-mile interface to the supply chain, and what are its physical and biological security characteristics in a world of delivery-based consumption and viral threats? What does the waste stream look like in a world of climate action and disruption of long-distance remote waste handling? What does “keeping up with the Joneses” look like when the Joneses mostly keep up with you on social media rather than visiting your home? The Yak Collective10 | How Homes Work Most obviously, “home” serves as storage space and simply somewhere to be by default. But homes also provide the means to establish and reflect personal identity. People choose, arrange, and decorate their homes in a way that reflects their current identities (or nudges them towards aspirational identities). Homes also give their occupants a stable, structured way to regulate their emotions. By moving through curated spaces, home users increase predictability and control over notoriously-ﬁckle moods. (For my pre-COVID statement on this topic, see this post) Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com Personal Identity ● Display achievements - awards ● Showcase loyalties - sports teams, countries/cities ● Keep hobbies front and center - cooking stuff Emotional Regulation ● Sparse & calm areas ● Decorated for homey-ness ● Separate spaces for different functions (e.g. home ofﬁce) Inspired by Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You (Sam Gosling) The Yak Collective11 | How Homes Work Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com Function Pre-Pandemic Mid- and Post-Pandemic Personal Identity: Others People have bifurcated into those who host guests and those who do not: ● Entertainers take more care to display what they wish for others to see ● Non-entertainers maintain “crash pad”-type homes, not geared towards the consumption of others. With home entertaining off the table for now, the other-facing function of home recedes. If entertaining at home resurges (as a safe alternative to gathering in groups in public), then projecting identity via one’s home will become more important than it was before. Personal Identity: Self For those who used to work many hours away from home, it became less necessary to identify via home space. If you’re spending nearly all your time at home, it almost necessarily becomes a primary source of identity. Mood Regulation Can outsource some mood functions to gyms, cafes, coworking spaces, etc. Heightened need to repatriate functions to the home via home gym, comfortable seating, dedicated home ofﬁce area, etc. The Yak Collective12 | How Homes Work: the Post-COVID world Like most changes, the post-COVID home offers beneﬁts and challenges distributed unevenly. Widespread uncertainty, fear, and ﬁnancial pressure due to COVID-19 are already threatening the mental health of millions of people around the world. Indicators suggest that the number of Americans struggling with anxiety and/or depression in May 2020 has doubled compared to a 2014 baseline. Stressed-out people, many whose jobs and plans have been upset by COVID-19, will want and need to marshall their homes for identity & mood regulation purposes. Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com Challenges Opportunities ● Increased pain in inhabiting a home that’s inappropriate, because you have to stay there more of the time. (too small, noisy area, misconﬁgured) ● It costs money to make homes fulﬁll the identity & mood functions well. (decorations, furniture, electronics) ● Moving homes is harder/riskier during lockdown and periods of pandemic uncertainty. ● A big nudge to ﬁnally make one’s home nice (for those who had neglected this before) ● More disposable income may become available due to other reductions in discretionary spending (fewer restaurant meals, trips, and other outings) ● Extraordinary times provide a good excuse for those who were already curious to experiment with alternate ways of life. The Yak Collective13 | How Homes Work: a Note on Space There’s nothing new about making trade-offs between a home’s location and the amount of personal space it offers. COVID-19 makes this situation suddenly more stark: during a pandemic the public/shared spaces that usually make small urban apartments work within the context of urban dwellers’ lives have become unavailable: gyms, coworking spaces, and even some parks. The tradeoff towards more private space, then, has coincidentally paid off much higher than usual. As the pandemic drags on, people with options may “temporarily” trade to larger less-urban spaces and like them, ﬁxing new preferences for a generation or more. Pamela J. Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People pamelajhobart.com City Apartment ● Identity function: If you can work from anywhere and don’t leave home, city-based identity loses its essence. ● Mood function: Cumbersome to regulate mood without discrete zone; multi-use spaces are not ideal for any purpose. Suburban/Rural House ● Identity function: Nondescript physical surroundings don’t imply milquetoast identity when socializing happens online ● Mood function: Space offers many possibilities for reliable mood regulation, (especially via physical activity & other recreation/hobbies, and for kids) The Yak Collective14 | Colonialising the Home Colonialism is fundamentally about creating a division, declaring one side ‘better’—the holy vs. the mundane [1]—and using that division as the basis for oppression, manipulation, and extraction. Colonialism has manifested itself in many ways during the 20th and 21st centuries, including right within our homes. The New Old Home cancels this bullshit—opening up the possibility of healing the rift.

Dynasty: A.I. Operator Being social creatures, humans show up in the world not strictly as individuals but as members of actual or aspirational “Units” (sometimes, not always, biological/genetic families). These \"Units\" also shape our approach to constructing our homes and our environment. The Units become sticky, because experimenting with them is costly—ﬁnancially, emotionally, and culturally. In the wake of the looming threat of nuclear war, Nuclear Units arose and led to ambitious experiments in suburban housing. Now, in the COVID-19 world, a new storm of COVID-19 Units is brewing, waiting to foment in a series of new experiments for living. These environmental Units can either ossify into Prediction Units, projecting a moment’s particular anxieties into the future and optimizing for the lowest common denominators; or ascend into Imperceptible Units, teeming with untimely signals that show a new path forward. The Chicago Projects: These projects were originally imagined as low-rise housing for the middle class in the wake of the depression (“Depression Units”). Budgetary constraints and explicit racism caused the plans to be weaponized against the poor, mostly-black community.

Watching Cronkite for Russian updates. Take harsh spatial divisions and a constant spectre of nuclear apocalypse for granted. They tell time via their spatial program. COVID-19 Units: Everyone forced back into one home. Ordering in. Looking at Twitter to see Trump cancel WHO. Take the collapse of spatial divisions for granted, cannot differentiate temporality, and collapse all data into the logics of ‘the curve.’ Prediction Units: project a moment’s anxieties into the future and optimize for the lowest common denominators. This is the Nuclear Family in 2015: it lives on in name/on paper, but not in spirit. Imperceptible Units: arise after unprecedented experiments: untimely, unconditioned, and teeming with signals. Imperceptible units push social frontiers, even without social legibility. COVID-19 Units Imperceptible Units Prediction Units Nuclear Units ACTIVE REACTIVE DETERMINISTIC OPEN-ENDEDPlaces & Spaces The Yak Collective21 | Domestic Cozy to Hard Cozy The current retreat to domesticity represents an acceleration of a trend that had already been underway for over a year when Covid19 hit : domestic cozy. I flagged and named the trend in early 2019. The concept was just beginning to gain memetic momentum in early 2020 when the pandemic knocked it to a whole new level of intensity. Domestic cozy represents a reversal of a previous decade-long trend that emphasized public appearances: premium mediocrity. Domestic cozy homes are low-proﬁle: they underpromise and overdeliver. In contrast, premium mediocre homes overpromise and underdeliver. Before Covid19: Domestic Cozy Venkatesh Rao venkateshrao.com Previously: Xerox Indie Status: 9+ years The Yak Collective22 | Domestic Cozy to Hard Cozy We can expect a rapid hardening and long-term persistence of core tendencies already present in domestic cozy. What might otherwise have been a short-lived fad might well turn into a generational posture for Gen Z as they grow older and establish households. The core traits of domestic cozy, all expressed through patterns of risk-averse domesticity, can be understood as a set of four retreats from archetypal spaces that are not cozy: ● Retreat from discomfort—airport-like spaces ● Retreat from ceremony—mansion-like spaces ● Retreat from deprivation—desert-like spaces ● Retreat from danger—mineﬁeld-like spaces After Covid19: Hard Cozy Venkatesh Rao venkateshrao.com Previously: Xerox Indie Status: 9+ years The Yak Collective23 | Housing Affordability: Prosperous, Shrinking Cities The wealthiest regions continue to lose population, and particularly young people, due to high cost of housing. ● About 6 million residents left CA since 2007, a net loss of 1 million. ● NYC loses ~38,000 young people each year (see chart). COVID-19 will accelerate this trend as labor markets soften but rental and homebuying markets do not: ● Lack of new construction keep supply low; and ● Mortgage forbearance options lessen sell pressure. Result: Housing as a labor sorting mechanism. High- productivity employees will live near HQs. Remote work in lower-cost cities will be viable, but with lower career ceiling. Benton Heimsath LA YIMBY Annual Net Migration of Residents ages 25–34, 2012–2017 “Old people are holding in place, but we are losing the younger generation. It is a slow-moving train wreck here.” – USC Professor Dowell Myers The Yak Collective24 | Housing Affordability: A Tale of Two Cities ● In high cost of living cities, people trade off commute time, safety, neighborhood amenities, and having children with housing costs. ● In lower cost of living cities, the trade-offs might instead include job opportunities and walkability. Compare Houston and Los Angeles: with similar median incomes, LA’s high cost of housing leaves many households floundering. Although COVID-19 won’t end cities (no pandemic has before), it does change the tradeoffs for now. Remote work, family-based childcare, and a privately-owned car seem more attractive than ever, at the same time as a “good school district” matters less.

As Zoom fatigue sets in, other existing tools and game engines are being hacked: with graduation ceremonies and concerts in Minecraft, a “wfh town” built in the collaborative design tool Figma, and ofﬁce meetings around a campﬁre in Red Dead Redemption 2. It remains to be seen how viable these spaces truly are: there’s only so much Animal Crossing a person can stand. In the meantime, as our home and work lives collapse into one space, how can we incorporate the positive qualities of a third space into our homes? Third Space A third space is a place to go that is separate from the two usual environments of home (\"the ﬁrst space\") and the workplace (\"the second space\"): Churches, cafes, clubs, public libraries, bookstores or parks. Places where you want to be, rather than places that you have to be. Drew Schorno drewschorno.com Clown school graduate. Failed startup alumni. Designed this deck while caring for Grandma at home. The Yak Collective26 | ⅓ Space What do physical third spaces offer at their best? 1.Lucky encounters with loose acquaintances, old friends, and the public: a sense of community. 2.Light-hearted and humorous conversation 3.An opportunity to temporarily forget about obligations 4.Freedom to come and go as you please 5.A sense of commonality and level hierarchy 6.Accommodating, accessible, and non-judgemental 7.A playful mood Drew Schorno drewschorno.com Clown school graduate.

The Yak Collective27 | Travel as Ritual The homes of people who can afford it are increasingly atomized: the number of functions for each room is lowered until you get ultra-speciﬁc rooms like “the meditation nook” in real estate listings—presumably for the sole purpose of meditating. The reason why this is desirable is that different physical spaces give your body a signal to prepare for different contexts of activities. The act of traveling between areas within a single home, or from your house to a separate ofﬁce space, can serve as a ritual that puts you into “working mode”, “sleeping mode”, “exercise mode”, etc. Perhaps it is possible to design new habits and rituals that make the idea of a uniﬁed space more bearable: the manual handling of a previously invisible and automatic experience.

The Yak Collective28 | A New Old Pattern Language Christopher Wolfgang Alexander is a design theorist whose cult-classic, A Pattern Language, revolutionized design thinking not only in architecture, but in software engineering as well as UI/UX design. A Pattern Language, as it stands, is a holistic design system adapted to life before Covid-19. As such, there is an emphasis on the socially-intimate village of, at times, 7000 people. This was appropriate then but serious foundational changes have to be considered now; for example, to a newfound cultural memory and impulses for/against social-distancing. By adapting Alexander’s existing scheme to the new challenges of a Post-Covid World, we can build A New Old Pattern Language. Developing and deploying a ﬁrst-principles-driven, uniform language will allow multiple agents to rapidly scale their rebuilds in self-consistent and harmonizing manners.

Most notably, early-20th-century modernism stemmed partly from the idea that sunlight and fresh air were the best cures for tuberculosis. That led to sanatorium-inspired houses with big windows, open spaces, outdoor areas, easily cleaned surfaces like tiles, and a white, sterile aesthetic. Until the coronavirus pandemic, the most pressing, world-altering issues for today’s top architects were climate change and income disparity. They focused on how to design sustainable homes that offer protection in the case of natural disasters like wildﬁres, floods and hurricanes, as well as methods to house people more affordably. With the external threat of the virus now creating the need for separation, architects report a new focus on the theory of prospect and refuge, in which a house design includes areas that allow occupants to both feel secure and to have the ability to observe the outside. Michael Colin Founder, CEO - MVMNT Supply Chain; Logistics; Freight Tech Twitter A house is not just a machine for living in but also a “convenient place for meditation and healing” – Le Corbusier The Yak Collective32 | The Home as a Curative Environment As germ theory became better understood, medical professionals knew that isolation was key to prevent the spread of tuberculosis. A person’s best hope for recovery was to live somewhere with plenty of fresh air, sunlight, rest, and nourishing food. The resulting design of sanatoria influenced Modernist architecture. Architectural elements like flat roofs, terraces and balconies, and white-painted rooms spread across Europe. Not unlike the sanatorium, the new architecture was intended to cure the perceived physical, nervous, and moral ailments brought on by crowded cities. Interior spaces, furniture, and ﬁxtures were also intended to assist the healing process. Custom sinks minimized noise (so as not to disturb the patient’s roommate) and splash, (to keep germs from spreading). Sanatorium-style chairs, angled to ease the patient’s breathing, became fashionable for domestic use in the middle class.

(PHOTO: Imagno/Getty Images) The Yak Collective33 | The Home as a Curative Environment Designers are rethinking the conﬁgurations of their own houses for a post-pandemic world. With the external threat of the virus now creating the need for separation, architects are focusing on the theory of prospect and refuge, in which a house design includes areas that allow occupants to both feel secure and to observe the outside. Speciﬁc forthcoming trends include: ● Entry vestibule as a hygiene station: Including separate bins for gloves, masks, shoes and other gear worn outside, a place for hand washing and sanitation wipes, and places to put shopping bags, recycling, and mail. More upscale homes may be equipped with a UV lamp that can can kill some pathogens. ● Facilitating no-contact delivery: Installation of no-contact appliances at homes, near the front door, for deliveries of all food or packages. ● Heightened puriﬁcation: Where water and air quality were previously more taken for granted, people harbor new worries about where viruses may lurk. “Smart homes” can go a step further, controlling both temperature and cleanliness of cirulating air.

How have these dynamics changed, and what’s in store for the coming decades? Prior to Industrial Revolution: ● Family businesses the main source of wealth. ● Goods and services often produced inside the home. ● Except for wealthy, education was informal and insourced 19th + 20th Centuries: ● Industry moves from home to factories and ofﬁces ● Mass migration to single-family homes, engineered by cooperation of ﬁnancial industry and the state ● Decoupling of education and home: movement towards formal and eventually compulsory out-of-home education 21st Century: ● What comes next?

The Yak Collective39 | Do Home Technologies Save Labor? It seems like labor-saving technologies should, well, save labor. But the story is much more complicated than it seems at ﬁrst. On the old home, the farm, everyone pitched in—men, women, and even young children. A few tasks were gendered by necessity (i.e. strength) or convention (e.g. cooking) but everyone busted their butt from sunrise to sunset. At the new home, devices and gadgetry alleviated some of these burdens—but only unevenly. Children no longer have to beat rugs, men no longer have to dry the dishes. But someone’s still left holding the vacuum cleaner bag—usually either the mom/wife. In single-occupant households, plenty is left to do. c.f.

Food work continues to be a timesink, despite the introduction of many appliances and conveniences. Why? Food Got Complicated 1.Parkinson’s Law: Tasks expand to ﬁll time. Appliances and gadgets may not save time so much as transform the nature of time spent. 2.Increases in food standards have swamped time savings. Managing taste, variety, and nutrition is a complex endeavor. Individual- and family-speciﬁc preferences mean that even ordering pre-made food takes a signiﬁcant amount of planning and care. 3.Food practices have moved up Maslow’s hierarchy towards identity for many people, so comparing them to those of the past is apples & oranges anyways. Case Study: A Closer Look at the Kitchen Pamela Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People Why does food work resist efﬁciency? The Yak Collective41 | Do Home Technologies Save Labor? When landscapes were remade to accommodate the personal automobile, women began having to travel to supermarkets and department stores to retrieve purchases (whereas previously many things were delivered). Although the variety of things for purchase skyrocketed and their relative prices plummeted, this cost household managers (i.e. women) the one nonrenewable resource: time. Having food and other consumer goods delivered to one’s home is, then, not a new invention of lazy startup yuppies. Instead, it is yet another return to former practices in the New Old Home. Home Delivery: It’s Not Lazy, It’s Traditional Pamela Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People The Yak Collective42 | Pamela Hobart Philosopher, Mother of 3 The Life Coach for Smart People Chores at the Old Farm Home Chores at the New Post-War Home Chores at the New Old Home Who does chores?: Everyone pitches in Housework is the “job” of non-breadwinner. Children make token contributions, as to earn allowance. Gender: Minimal relevance. Household labor assigned mostly to women. Abandonment of the failed standard that men and women should split 50/50. Idiosyncratic divisions based on amount & nature of other responsibilities. Outsourcing: Minimal & sporadic help from outside the household. Some outsourcing by upper-class women to lower-class women Technologies: Simple tools that make farm work possible to do at all (plows, stoves) Appliances save some manual labor, but running and maintaining homes ﬁlled with them still takes many hours per week. Although chores are less physically exhausting, the juggling of so many moving parts remains cognitively demanding. Personal knowledge management & productivity practices become applicable to the home. Time: inherent rhythm of day/season/year Time is strongly bifurcated between work/home, and across gender lines. Time poverty for everyone, unless carefully guarded against via household-level trial and error.

Consulting blog / twitter / LinkedIn The uncertainty of the new world leaves consumers yearning for order. Order used to come from the external demands imposed by institutions. In corona-time, the power to control our calendars has been given back to the people. For those without the anchors of children or “essential jobs,” the old structure of the day has melted away. Now we get order from our own internal motivation. Instead of a daily commute we take a morning walk. Instead of going to the gym, we work out at home. Instead of lunch with our parents, it’s a weekend Zoom call. We impose routine on our days. Consumers, previously creatures of habit travelling well-worn paths, now plan their days more fully, forging their habits anew. Successful brands will help consumers remake these habits.

Consulting blog / twitter / LinkedIn While consumers crave reliable, predictable routine, they don’t want every day to be the same. Stuck at home, people are tired of doing the same things with the same people 24/7. Mere routine is not enough. To delight customers, brands must offer “minimum viable novelty”—inject a little randomness into people’s days. The most memorable times are when you break from routine. On the commute you sometimes have to give a tourist directions, or bump into an old friend. What are the at-home equivalents for IRL serendipity? People want both order and “minimum viable novelty” Case Study: Peloton Peloton provides order: regular spin classes with the same instructor at the same time and place each day Peloton provide novelty: consistently release new playlists, tracking metrics, and different classes So it’s growing fast: Yearly sales CAGR of 91%, and a Net Promoter Score of 91, higher than both Apple and Netflix. Trend alert: New Yorkers’ “Peloton nooks” Working from the New Old Home The Yak Collective47 | From Oikos to Polis and Back Ancient Greek city-states adopted the form of the self-governing polis to solve the problems of collective decision-making. This also changed the role of of oikos—the “household”—and moved the most important decisions from domestic spaces to the collective ones. The modern company is also organized to solve for collective decision-making. Like the polis, companies designate decision-makers (then, heads-of-household; now, senior executives) vs. decision-takers (formerly women and slaves; now, middle managers and rank-and-ﬁle employees). Like the polis, company collectivities increase interdependency, security, and expected outcomes. Now that “polis” workers are working from “oikos” spaces, how will their needs and capabilities change? David McDougall Director of Product, Arabesque S-Ray Founder, Lusiad Innovation Newsletter, LinkedIn The Oikos Principle: “When economic production moves back to the home, household management (oikonomia, “economics”) takes precedence over group decision-making (politeia, “politics”)” The Yak Collective48 | From Oikos to Polis and Back Over the last ~300 years, companies evolved to take on many of the organizational and structural forms of the polis. Larger decisions are made by people who wield responsibility for larger units, while smaller decisions are left to the levels below. “Open plan” ofﬁces mimic agora (public square/marketplace) designs to encourage the free-flow of ideas, objectives, and people. The workplace plays the role of public sphere—whereas a household is something to which one returns. Home life must be outsourced (to domestic laborers, or stay-at-home partners), or remains an after-hours burden. The Corporate Polis David McDougall Director of Product, Arabesque S-Ray Founder, Lusiad Innovation Newsletter, LinkedIn via @davidhuber_ on Twitter The Yak Collective49 | From Oikos to Polis and Back Thanks to a global pandemic and widespread internet connection, the “workplace” lives entirely inside the private sphere (at least for now). A household isn’t something you return to, it once again serves as the primary place of everyone’s economic production. This new oikos is “unevenly distributed” of course—who gets to work from home? Freelancers and stay-at-home-parents ﬁnd themselves way ahead of the curve. Focus falls, once again, on the links between work and life, rather than on their separation. In 2020, the question is: How many of these changes are permanent?

Groups of people have almost always lived together; the late 20th and early 21st century idea of only two adults and their children in one house is new. (Census data from pre-WWII almost always has multiple surnames per household) The nuclear household suits capitalism—more households buy more goods and services. This doesn’t mean “one house”—a cluster of houses nearby works too, and the North European ‘hamlet’ style and African village settlements are the norm through 95% of human history. Drew Shiel Independent Domestic Historian Moderator at AskHistorians Look for historical family portraits, pre-WWII. How many have only two adults? The Yak Collective53 | The Nuclear Family is Anomalous Small numbers in a household: 1.Lack of carers when one or two adults are ill 2.More exposures for grocery trips and other essentials 3.Essential tasks all fall on one or two people 4.No support if both nuclear-family parents work from home 5.Cabin fever The Nuclear Family is weak in a Crisis - like a Pandemic Drew Shiel Independent Domestic Historian Moderator at AskHistorians The Yak Collective54 | The Nuclear Family is Anomalous Larger Households 1.(Multi-generational, co-housing, cooperatives, kibbutzim, medieval Great Household, etc) 2.Share out tasks 3.Minimise infection vectors or risky trips 4.Support (cooking, child-minding) for people WFH or in gig economy 5.More people to talk to Larger Households are a Historic Fallback Drew Shiel Independent Domestic Historian Moderator at AskHistorians The Yak Collective55 | Visible Knowledge Work Knowledge work in the context of the home and family life has largely been invisible—the worker “goes to work” (an ofﬁce/co-working space/coffee shop) holding a phone and a coffee and returns at the end of the day without the coffee. The days of briefcases, printed documents, signage, and tools are all evaporating from family life. This invisible knowledge work provides zero visibility into what the knowledge work looks or feels like for partners and kids. The unit of work across all knowledge work—the meeting—lives on a digital calendar, often not shared or only shared opaquely with the family unit. Tom Critchlow Digital Strategy & Media Design Indie Status: 5+ years Home Ofﬁce The Yak Collective56 | Visible Knowledge Work Kids learn & process the world through imitation—and most of this happens in the home (or at school). However, the pandemic has made knowledge work more visible and my own daughter has taken to imitating zoom calls, typing emails, taking conference calls and more. What effect will this have on the long term embedded mental model of “work” and “work cultures” for kids who suddenly get a peek into what knowledge work looks, feels and sounds like.

This brings a visibility and tangibility to previously invisible knowledge work. Some examples: ● The home calendar and work calendars now require syncing ● Zoom calls for work with children on your knee ● Shared meal times and shared diets (homes don’t have micro-kitchens) ● Ambient awareness of meetings, projects, calls, across the home via over-hearing ● Printed reports sitting next to printed kids art projects Tom Critchlow Digital Strategy & Media Design Indie Status: 5+ years Home Ofﬁce The Yak Collective58 | Visible Knowledge Work As we enter an age of projection, machine vision and e-ink—every surface is going to become a display.

Although the school buildings aren’t open, “distance learning” means parents must assume much more of an educational burden than they had intended. At the same time, parents’ knowledge economy jobs still present signiﬁcant burden (perhaps even more so as they compete head-to-head with childless colleagues with fewer social options). How long before parents try to kill two birds with one stone: foregoing burdensome, ineffective online lesson plans and bringing their children on as apprentices? If school largely exists to perpetuate these families’ upper middle class status, why not cut to the chase and accrue work experience now?

Knowledge work is more abstract, but can be characterized in terms of architecting data systems for processing massive amounts of data. Layers of a knowledge processing system: ● Accumulate and organize key set of data (i.e. facts) ● Batch process facts into aggregates (i.e. \"make sense of\" the data) ● Accumulate real-time facts quickly ● Move real-time facts into core data set ● Accept arbitrary questions about your data ● Return an answer about your data Chris Clark Daylight: Product Manager, YouTube Moonlight: Freelance Data Projects What does a knowledge work apprenticeship look like?

Thomas Verhagen clipper.earth Previously at Cambridge University, ABN Amro Caption North American 2019 demographic pyramid & Longwood mansion, Nanchez, MS, U.S. The Yak Collective71 | Pandemic Coparenting Censuses and national surveys have gradually acknowledged variations on the nuclear family. These snapshots are static and fail to take into account the dynamics of children who live in multiple households, often as the result of formal or informal custody arrangements between parents. Pre-pandemic, this was an issue the State was willing to be blind to. Households are more legible if children aren’t being double-counted, and this is made easier by simply mandating for parents to “pick a household” when reporting. Jordan Peacock Father, entrepreneur, philosopher Becoming Machinic, Sortilege, Yak Collective Post-pandemic, however, every movement to or from another household traces a new set of contacts and open up new risk vectors. Moreover, in situations where: ● court access may be limited or nonexistent, and ● ability to ﬁle motions or go to trial for “non-essential” cases may be deferred until further notice Parents are forced to make choices that leave them open to legal risks, in most areas without case law or precedent. The Yak Collective72 | Pandemic Coparenting Most people would prefer that the government not need to know or care about the speciﬁcs of their household arrangements. Having a child with you 49% or 51% of the year, however, might mean substantially different things for your taxes, or your insurance. Jordan Peacock Father, entrepreneur, philosopher Becoming Machinic, Sortilege, Yak Collective During a pandemic, co-parenting arrangements becomes difﬁcult-to-illegal as governments attempt to mitigate risks by imposing state-at-home orders. This can be a catch-22, if the arrangements are court mandated, sometimes with severe penalties including risks of jail time, ﬁnes, or removal of children. Contact tracing programs or apps are, in some areas, beginning to outline the contours where the map failed to reflect the territory of the lives of children with more than one home. Nations and organizations are seeing a need for improving their mapping of households, and families are recognizing that better information may be necessary to mitigate deﬁcient policies. The Yak Collective73 | Pandemic Coparenting There may be a lag, but institutions and law will catch up. The future, however, will be unevenly distributed due to the fragmented nature of domestic and international family law and services. It may be up to parents and children affected to form advocacy networks that transcend jurisdictional borders: to identify best practices that strike a balance between providing clarity and visibility into dynamic household arrangements, and maintaining the privacy of children and their families, and to campaign for these best practices to be broadly implemented. Jordan Peacock Father, entrepreneur, philosopher Becoming Machinic, Sortilege, Yak Collective Towards the New Old Home The Yak Collective75 | Activating Multiple Digital Personae COVID-19 has turned remote-working into remote-living. Interactions with our clients, colleagues, friends and family are all taking place through our screens. We're no longer able to slip out of our computers and into the 'real-world' to fulﬁll our multiple social roles. Instead we're having to ﬁll these roles at homes by switching between multiple digital personae. There is an opportunity to activate these digital personae by exercising control over their formation. Building a self-awareness that extends beyond the 'real-world' and into your digital interactions will help you craft projected personae that others will perceive the way that you intend. The forms of your personae don't need to be ﬁxed or permanent: they should be modiﬁed according to the explicit or tacit feedback you receive in your interactions. This modulation will help your personae achieve the most fruitful digital interaction possible.

This TechCrunch story about couples as co-founders offers a perspective on what happens when doerism eats the home. Doerism Eats the Home Sachin Benny Product Marketing at CDK Global Previously: marketing consultant with early stage and series A software products. ““Once we raise the Series D, we’ll start thinking about having kids,” jokes Calley—in what may not actually be a joke.” “They co-founded Anomalie, a wedding dress customization startup that has raised $18.1 million. Instead of vacationing to Bora Bora the day after their wedding, the newlywed founders hopped on a plane to China, where Leslie stayed for a couple of months to set up the supply chain for Anomalie. The couple admits that even now, they don’t make time for their personal lives.” “We weighed the risk of divorce and decided to take it. We gained a team fully invested in the company and one that could balance personal life and startup life.” “If we hadn’t been working together, our separation process would have been different. There were truths that needed to be spoken that were emotionally difﬁcult in a marriage, that I didn’t want to put on Josh in the middle of a big Target partnership launch.” The Yak Collective78 | The Limits of Home Production Recognizing the limits of the home as space for labour, production, and meaning-making could help deﬁne better metaphors that are more imaginative and expansive than doerism. The emergence of the New Old Home seems to have parallels to the explosion of digital peer production during the web 2.0 era. Peer production was seen as replacement to industrial bureaucracy. The New Old Home replaces corporate work-life balance and changes industrial bureaucratic norms. Fred Turner explores the limits of peer production in the paper: The limits of peer production: Some reminders from Max Weber for the network society. The optimistic claims about peer production that Fred Turner refutes can be mapped to the optimism of the home as a productive unit.

Optimism of Peer Production Optimism of Productive Home Limits of Productive Home Pursuing psychologically gratifying labor within peer production is an unqualiﬁed good. Pursuing psychologically gratifying labour within home is an unqualiﬁed good. Working at/from home may undermine private autonomy and turn previously pleasurable activities into labour. Peer networks are an egalitarian and efﬁcient means of producing knowledge work. The productive home treats all labour as equal. with no dehumanizing bureaucracy. Bureaucratic norms and rulemaking could extend into the home. Peer production necessarily realizes ethical relationships between collaborators. Homes necessarily foster ethically-better relationships than corporate structures. Since homes are private, they can easily shelter abuse and oppression away from the public eye. Peer production is equally suited to all domains of social activity All kinds of work/production/meaning-making can happen at home. Time-for-money gig work and remote work threatens to degrade the home as a place of rest. Peer production is extra-market and non-proprietary. Homes can be decentralized units of production, outside the burdensome structures of industrialization. Professionalization of the home could transform homes into mere extensions of the corporation. The Yak Collective80 | New Narratives for the New Old Home The collective experience of a sudden mass transition to working from home has made approaches previously considered impractical (if not impossible) now necessary. Pushing work into the home has challenged traditional narratives of the relationship between work and home, creating space for new attitudes and behaviours that may linger for some time. It is yet to be seen if snapping back to our former norms will be a viable option; even less certain is if this will be desirable. Here I’ve explored three different narratives of the role of home in terms of work: a dominant narrative from pre-COVID times, a narrative for working from home as an interim measure mid-COVID, and an aspirational narrative for how work and home might become intertwined post-COVID (whatever that may mean). Of course, there are many types of work and ways to make meaning; I have focused on knowledge-based work performed in an organisation.
