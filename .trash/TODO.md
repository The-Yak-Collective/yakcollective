	- [ ] Obsidian
	- [ ] Foam
	- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Recreate build and automation infrastructure using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
	- `.automation`
	- `.github`
- [ ] Implement [`foam janitor`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-cli) as an on-commit GitHub Action
- [ ] Reimplement join page form using [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)
- [ ] Move [IT infrastructure map](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/w6uAG9Pig) from DOT/Graphviz to something like Mermaid
	- ChatGPT makes a decent first-pass, but it doesn't really understand multi-path commands
	- The goal here is Foam/GitHub compatability
	- Add it to the `private` directory
	- Probably should rebuild SVG on update...
	- Archive the [current repo](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/infrastructure-map) when done
	- Not *technically* part of this project, but makes sense to slot in here...
