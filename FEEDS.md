# Member RSS Feeds

Below is a list of member RSS feeds that are aggregated under `writings/_posts`. Right now, we don't do anything with the content of these posts, instead using them to generate a list of recent member writings and drive traffic to _their_ websites. You can see the list of current writings at https://yakcollective.org/writings/. To learn how individual posts are pushed from IFTTT to https://yakcollective.org, check out the [`yakcollective-ifttt-connector` repo](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective-ifttt-connector).

If you want to add yourself to this list or update an existing feed, ping Nathan Acks, Tom Critchlow, or Venkatesh Rao, or submit a pull request against this file.
