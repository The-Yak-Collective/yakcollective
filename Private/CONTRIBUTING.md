## Editing the Website
This site is actually a [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) wiki; to edit, clone the repository, open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then install the recommended extensions.

Files in this `/Private` directory are *not* included in the final website build; the [[README]] file becomes the site homepage in the final build. Note that when referring to a Yak Collective member, it's important to use their ID in a full link (`[Nathan Acks](https://www.yakcollective.org/members/100007/)`); this is an unfortunate limitation of having member data stored off-site (for GDPR compliance), but a quick [reference](Knack%20Member%20ID%20Map.md) is provided to make things a little bit easier.
