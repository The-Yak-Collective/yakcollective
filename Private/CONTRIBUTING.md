## Editing the Website
This site is actually a [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) wiki; to edit, clone the repository, open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then install the recommended extensions.

Files in this `/Private` directory are *not* included in the final build, while the [[README]] file becomes the site homepage. Note that when referring to a Yak Collective member, it's important to use their ID in a full link (`[Nathan Acks](https://www.yakcollective.org/members/100007/)`). Tthis is an unfortunate limitation of having member data stored off-site (for GDPR compliance), but the [members page](../Members.md) can be used as a quick reference.
