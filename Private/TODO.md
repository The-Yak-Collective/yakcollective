# Website Foam Migration Tasks
- [x] Remove `_post` subdirectories (requires modifications to the Pluto RSS feed pull scripts)
- [x] Finish `update-pluto-lists.sh` (generate lists for `Newsletter.md` and `Writings.md` from Planet Pluto databases)
- [x] Add RSS feed creation for "writings" to `update-list.sh`
- [x] Make sure that everything builds right still
- [x] Merge [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) VS Code template and set up wiki
- [x] Change template "not below" line to include `----` borders
- [ ] Foam-ify all `.md` files
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Agglomerizing the Aesthetic.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Department of Restoration.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Mechanical Turks All the Way Down.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Out of the Loop.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Wholeness in a Timeless Activity.md`
	- `Projects/Astonishing Stories/Your Payment is Ready.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/01.01.01 On Horizons.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.01.01 Democratized Underwater Exploration.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.01.02 Democratized Underwater Exploration.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.01.03 Democratized Underwater Exploration.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.01.04 Democratized Underwater Exploration.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.02.01 The Promise of Nanosatellites for Developing Nations.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.02.02 The Promise of Nanosatellites for Developing Nations.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/02.02.03 The Promise of Nanosatellites for Developing Nations.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/03.01.01 Starship Gold Rush.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/03.01.02 Starship Gold Rush.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/05.01.01 Designer Metabolism and Minds.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/05.01.02 Designer Metabolism and Minds.md`
	- `Projects/Future Frontiers/99.99.99 Contribute to Future Frontiers.md`
	- `Projects/New Old Home.md`
- [x] Move away from using `[[custom|naming]]` for better GitHub compatability
- [ ] Move to using sentence-case filenames and headings
- [ ] Make sure that all all pages are linked to each other
- [ ] Auto-generate content list page content, similar to how `Newsletter.md` and `Writings.md` is handled (should be able to order by date and have a concept of active/inactive; maybe as a git commit hook for some of these?)
	- [ ] `Study Groups.md`
	- [ ] `Projects.md`
	- [ ] `Work Groups.md`
	- [ ] `README.md`
	- [x] `Members.md`
- [ ] Can I create a page that automatically pulls in recordings? Or alternately, stub pages that link out to those?
- [ ] Implement [`foam janitor`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-cli) as an on-commit GitHub Action
- [ ] New, simpler, Foam-compatible theme
	- Return to using "Yak Gold" as our default accent color
	- Allow overrides *but no Jekyll-isms in `.md` files*!
		- Custom accent color
		- Custom banners
		- Custom RSS link ("original URL")
		- Additional headers
	- How to handle RSS feeds? Maybe GitHub created/updated? Specially marked pages?
	- Can this be made GitHub-compatible, [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html)-style?
- [x] Create a page in `/Private` providing a mapping between Yak Collective member names and IDs
- [ ] Create an `.automation/etc/overlay` directory containing Yak Collective customizations
	- The goal is to make everything generalizable
	- Scripts in `.automation/bin` will also require some generalization... Or maybe a custom config file?
- [ ] Move [IT infrastructure map](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/w6uAG9Pig) from DOT/Graphviz to something like Mermaid
	- ChatGPT makes a decent first-pass, but it doesn't really understand multi-path commands
	- The goal here is Foam/GitHub compatability
	- Add it to the `/Private` directory
	- Probably should rebuild SVG on update...
	- Archive the [current repo](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/infrastructure-map) when done
	- Not *technically* part of this project, but makes sense to slot in here...
