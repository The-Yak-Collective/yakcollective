What might a solid stack for democratized underwater exploration look like?

- **Grand challenges and missions:** Suited to democratized exploration
- **Strong explorer community:** Comparable to open source, maker movement, astronomy
- **Open-source software tools:** To process data from community oceanic infrastructure
- **Infrastructure relations:** With research institutions, commercial shipping, military 
- **Piggyback capabilities:** For opportunistic staging, deployment, communications, and telemetry
- **Hardware foundation:** High-quality, low-cost, high-variety hardware with greater range, endurance, and sensor payloads
