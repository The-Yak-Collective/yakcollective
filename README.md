# Yak Collective Website README
![NetlifyÂ Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/943ff646-41b6-4b4b-ab86-a891698c72c7/deploy-status)

Every collective needs a website. This is ours. It isn't much to look at, but it gets the job done.

## Editing the Website
This site is actually a [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) wiki; to edit, clone the repository, open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then install the recommended extensions.

This README directory is *not* included in the final website build; instead, you'll want to start at the [[index|index]]. Note that when referring to a Yak Collective member, it's important to use their ID in a full link (`[Nathan Acks](/members/100007.html)`); this is an unfortunate limitation of having member data stored off-site (for GDPR compliance), but a quick [[Knack Member ID Map|reference]] is provided to make things a little bit easier.
