# The Yak Collective

Home page of the Yak Collective projects.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/943ff646-41b6-4b4b-ab86-a891698c72c7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/practical-lichterman-20c7e0/deploys)

## Updating Members

Member data can be found in `_data/members.yml`. Set `partner` to `true` to include in the _Partners_ block. Add (or remove) elements from `feeds` to tweak fetched posts.

## Development

Significant website changes should be made using short-lived [topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) that are merged into `netlify-prod` when ready. The Yak Collective Netlify account can be used to create temporary websites when such changes need to be reviewed broadly.

## Make It Go

To build things locally...

```sh
bundler config set path vendor/bundle
./yak-build.sh
```

When doing local development, you may want to run `./yak-build.sh serve` rather than just `./yak-build`; this will fire up Jekyll's local server mode so that you can connect to http://localhost:4000 and browse the current version of the site.

To build things on Netlify...

1. Just push a change to the repo, or

2. If you do nothing, an [automation in IFTTT](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/netlify-ifttt/) will automatically trigger a rebuild once a day using a webhook.

## Documentation

Here's a quick rundown of the moving parts here.

### Pages

- `about.md`
- `feed.writings.json`

	[JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) for member writings, structured after John Gruber's feed on [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) (e.g., posts link back to the original article, and _not_ yakcollective.org).

- `feed.writings.xml` RSS feed, equivalent to `feed.writings.json`.
- `index.html`
- `members.html`
- `projects/*`
- `writings.html`

	This page is built using data pulled in from member RSS feeds.

### Assets

- `css/*`
- `images/*`

### Templates

Pages in the `_layouts` folder:

- `minimal.html`

	Minimal layout that assumes the page includes all needed elements. Currently used on the [Members](https://yakcollective.org/members) page, [Projects](https://yakcollective.org/projects/) index, and [homepage](https://yakcollective.org/).

- `page.html`

	Normal layout for stand-alone pages.

- `post.html`

	Layout for posts. Every post is assumed to have an author defined in `_data/members.yml`.

- `project.html`

	Fancier formatting for project pages.

### Shared Elements

Reusable elements from the `_includes` folder:

- `analytics.html`

	Google Analytics code; included on all pages by proxy through `_includes/head.html`.

- `footer.html`

	Standard page footers.

- `head.html`

	Standard page headers.

- `member-card-html`

	Reusable "member card" element, currently used on the [Members](https://yakcollective.org/members) page and the `_layouts/post.html` template.

- `nav.html`

	User-visible page header with navigational elements; included on all pages by proxy through `_includes/head.html`.

- `toc.html`

	Table of contents for `_layouts/page.html` elements. Does unreal things with Liquid. Probably black magic.

- `yak-wisdom-box.html`

	Project card for the [_Don't Waste the COVID-19 Reboot_](https://yakcollective.org/projects/yak-wisdom) project. Really should be replaced by a more generic element.

### Build Infrastructure

- `_config.yml`
- `Gemfile`
- `Gemfile.lock`
- `yak-build.sh`

	Website go brrr.

- `yak-make-ini.rb`

	Generate an `ini` file suitable for [Pluto](https://github.com/feedreader/pluto) using the member feed data in `_data/members.yml`. Called automatically by `yak-build.sh`.

- `yak-make-posts.rb`

	Use [Pluto](https://github.com/feedreader/pluto) to generate posts from member feeds. We don't expose these posts right now (except through `feeds.writings.json` and `feeds.writings.xml`), but then use the information in the files generated by this script to populate the [Writings](https://yakcollective.org/writings) page.
