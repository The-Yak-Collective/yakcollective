- [ ] Right now, all HTML files in `_posts` are completely excluded from git, under the assumption that they will be auto-generated by Pluto. This works fine for now, but may be a problem if we want to include actual posts on the site in the future (unless people are willing to just write in Markdown).

- [ ] Jekyll [doesn't support pagination over categories](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/), which means we have the following (not-so-great) choices:

	- Only use `_posts` for member RSS feed entries.

	- Mix up member RSS feed entries and other categories.

	- Don't use pagination (what is currently done).

	Fixing this will require either a custome plugin (which we may have to write ourselves) or migrating to a different generator (I know that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) supports this; not sure about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)).

- [ ] The current link style doesn't quite match the one Tom Critchlow originally created. The reason for this is that it's been adapted to use relative units so that it scales better (necessary for post pages). It can probably be made to match more exactly, but doing so will require additional classes for large font sizes (as otherwise these look off).
