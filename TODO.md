# TODO

- [ ] Remove `_post` subdirectories (requires modifications to the Pluto RSS feed pull scripts)
- [ ] Merge [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) VS Code template and set up wiki
- [ ] Foam-ify all `.md` files
- [ ] New, simpler, Foam-compatible theme
	- Return to using "Yak Gold" as our default accent color
	- Return to light/dark automatic theming
	- Allow overrides *but no Jekyll-isms in `.md` files*!
		- Custom accent color
		- Custom banners
		- Custom RSS link ("original URL")
		- Additional headers
	- How to handle RSS feeds? Maybe GitHub created/updated?
	- Can this be made GitHub-compatible, [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html)-style?
- [ ] Move [IT infrastructure map](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/w6uAG9Pig) from DOT/Graphviz to something like Mermaid
	- The goal here is Foam/GitHub compatability
	- Maybe add it as a (hidden) page here?
		- Maybe I want an entire `private` directory that isn't published?
	- Archive the [current repo](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/infrastructure-map) when done
	- Not *technically* part of this project, but makes sense to slot in here...
