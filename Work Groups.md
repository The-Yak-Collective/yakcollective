# Yak Collective Work Groups

Yak Collective work groups maintain the environment necessary for [[Study Groups|study groups]] and [[Projects|projects]] to function. This is everything from building [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots and [this website](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective) to providing proofing, layout, and artwork.
