**(This event is now over. Thank you to all presenters and participants!)**

A lot's changed since early 2020. One thing hasn't: the Yak Collective continues to slouch towards another year. It’s third. To mark the occasion — and to usher in 2023 — we're holding a week-long interactive tinkering session: **YakCon**.

The core of YC is synchronous study, collaboration, and tinkering sessions with async research and comms. Both occur at an easy, sustainable tempo with an infinite game outlook.

YakCon reflects this. It's a week-long interactive tinkering session. It isn't a broadcast. It's not your typical AGM. It's a participatory open house.
