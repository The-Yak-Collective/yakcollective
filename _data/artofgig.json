So pitch that - pitch stepping away from managing existing business functions and build something new. That's often the role of the consultant and if you can do that you'll get a taste of indie work. At the same time - don't forget to talk publicly about the transition. Building a network and profile is crucial for the transition to indie”\nThis is a good read on the difference between problem solving and capacity building. Many folks imagine themselves being problem solvers but it's much better to be a capacity builder: https://thesystemsthinker.com/consultants-as-problem-solvers-or-capacity-builders/\n\"mulling this advice I might revise my answer. If you're serious about transitioning to indie life I think the single most valuable thing your current role gives you is a steady paycheck and air cover (financially and emotionally) to build towards indie nights/weekends. Building a network, getting the word out, building up your indie instincts. These are more valuable than role playing as a consultant inside your existing org. Double down on the middle manager easy brainless job and take the paycheck and build up reserves for the leap\nI think it's straightforward to articulate but hard to pull off - like running every day. Simply starting a wiring practice- documenting your thinking and ideas\nI think the key things writing (i.e. blogging) gives you is: a) an awareness that you're \"for hire\" and b) what projects you would be a good fit for.

Rework is the speed killer. Principle of getting inside OODA loops is similar. You don’t want to necessarily iterate faster than the adversary, you want to operate inside their decision cycle. You might be able to do that while being slower. Knudsen’s big innovation at Chevrolet, which allowed him to beat Ford (in a way beating himself because he set up Ford’s initial leadership) was annual model updates and mass customization of color choices.

However, they cannot stop at being novel. To be innovative, they must also be buildable, and there must be a big enough group of customers that want to and have the ability to buy them.\n\nThe reality is that innovation is hard to do.\n\nInnovation work is fundamentally different from all other types of work because it involves uncertainty both in how to do the work and in what the work is intended to achieve—ie both __how to proceed__ and __what success means__ are inherently uncertain. The inherent uncertainty of innovation work makes it uniquely challenging for large, established corporations because they are organised to execute and optimise an existing repeatable and scalable business model.\n\nMaking big corporations more innovative requires first framing the problems, then identifying the solutions. Corporations hire traditional consulting companies to do this for them all the time. Their problem-framings are usually uninteresting, and their solutions ineffective. One boring obstacle to innovation is simply not having the “right” innovation resources in-house. A boring solution to this problem is mergers and acquisitions (M&A), in which a corporation fuses with or buys another, presumably more innovative, corporation. (This usually doesn’t work.)\n\nA Yak might frame the problem differently and come up with unconventional and more effective solutions. An example of a weirder view might be that large corporations are siloed, and that innovation-relevant goals and skills aren’t mutually legible across silos. A Yak-solution to this problem might be to create a team of part-time employees whose role is specifically to cross silos and make goals/skills legible across the organization—human mRNA.\n\nBetween M&A and human mRNA lies an enormous range of possible problem-framings and solutions.

Where people will either remotely access or log in, in a fashion, to an artificial body. If it’s a robot body, or something constructed with synthetic polymers, something like that, in order to reduce the risk of injury to actual human beings. Because I think you’re starting to see that more and more—especially in football players, but in other sports as well—that people are starting to understand that there is a toll that sports takes on a human body. As a society, we have to ask ourselves a question—is this worth it to us in order to be entertained? Is it worth it to us to have people drop dead after a race? Or to be crippled for life in order that we can watch and be entertained?

Let’s say in boxing, when you have people sparring versus during an actual bout, you see quite a bit of differences in terms of punch forces and what is sustained during the fight. So I think having some more of the real-time monitoring of all sports—football, baseball, everything—will provide that instant feedback. That’s kind of what we’re all about now in the world, and in the U.S. specifically, is getting that instant feedback and having those numbers and those metrics right away so you can make decisions.

Korean solo artists and groups borrow from and cite instrumentation and vocals of R&B genres, especially hip hop. They also enhance the R&B tradition by utilizing Korean musical strategies. These musical citational practices are deemed authentic by global fans who function as part of K-pop’s music press and promotional apparatus. K-pop artists also cite elements of African American performance in Korean music videos. These disrupt stereotyped representations of Asian and African American performers. Through this process K-pop has arguably become a branch of a global R&B tradition. Anderson argues that Korean pop groups participate in that tradition through cultural work that enacts a global form of crossover and by maintaining forms of authenticity that cannot be faked, and furthermore propel the R&B tradition beyond the black-white binary.","uid":"BebMs1p18","edit-time":1594782812674,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"}],"uid":"G3raFwp40","edit-time":1594782909562,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"}],"uid":"zkptedCde","edit-time":1594782826509,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594782781015,"uid":"licooBBKa","edit-time":1594782781015,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594777354674,"uid":"RWwTSYCkb","edit-time":1594777354674,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"Tweets","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594777354836,"heading":2,"uid":"SScLo8ROt","edit-time":1594777358715,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"https://twitter.com/Millicentsomer/status/1281414271692234753","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594782219286,"uid":"tHhNToKuH","edit-time":1594782221543,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"https://twitter.com/carolinesinders/status/1281360320645271553?s=20","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594780451618,"uid":"Bq-c1H-Sp","edit-time":1594780453526,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"https://twitter.com/beeeaanz/status/1281001263451299840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1281001263451299840%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fdennis-rodman-video-message-kanye-west-1517777","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594778581605,"uid":"G2oFPxJEU","edit-time":1594778583314,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"**cory doctorow thread:** https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1274741763878424581","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594776235018,"uid":"5qrKafjJG","edit-time":1594777359124,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"https://twitter.com/hashtag/calminkirkland?src=hashtag_click","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594777490052,"uid":"z_tl-S3kZ","edit-time":1594777492181,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594777336590,"uid":"KlUPlrl9p","edit-time":1594777336590,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"Images","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594776219752,"heading":2,"uid":"k5v-FLRhR","edit-time":1594777338776,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FArtOfGig%2FLETSTUPU3b.png?alt=media&token=8b822d87-3cbf-43cc-b990-c00181f21991)","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594777344043,"uid":"Uk-rqCEz3","edit-time":1594777377604,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"}],"edit-time":1594854580912,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"title":"July 15th, 2020","edit-time":1594845405079,"edit-email":"muloureiro@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594854584981,"title":"Trends-and-Futures – 07/17/2020 – K-Pop Fandom Politicization","children":[{"string":"Social activism vs. political activism","create-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com","create-time":1594854588377,"uid":"T8FuqTbB8","edit-time":1594854622843,"edit-email":"alex.wagner5@gmail.com"},{"string":"Weeks ago, K-Pop stans singlehandedly trashed not only the attendance of a Trump rally in Tulsa, OK, but also the resultant email list, which was chock full of burner email addresses and telephone numbers.
