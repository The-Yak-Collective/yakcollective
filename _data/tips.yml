tips:

    tip: Your consulting True Name must be kept a secret except from other consultants with whom you have shared a gig.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Every gig is a parallel universe with its own timeline. Discover the bandwidth of your personal multiverse as early as you can.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Define scopes, not rules. Instead of asking, "should I do this?" ask, "under what circumstances would it be a no-brainer to do or not do this?" In consulting, circumstances vary a lot more than in employment.

    tip: Pack a protein bar and a light sweater when visiting client sites. You never know how cold they'll have the AC set, or whether or not there will be snacks/food to suit your nibbling needs.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to increase the client's rate of making trigger decisions. Except when it isn't.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Trust, but verify, things your client says. Treat them as you would a sympathetic but unreliable narrator in a novel. Just because you're on their side doesn't mean they have their story straight.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not automatically nod along when a client criticizes people you don't know. Instead, challenge with more conservative alternate reads of the hearsay evidence. "Based on how you say he acted on the call, sounds like he might just be insecure after the reorg."
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Never let a missionary purpose in your head get in the way of hearing what the client is saying.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Tour offices at every possible opportunity. Observe layout, patterns of proximity, naming/numbering conventions for physical infrastructure like conference rooms, furniture, break rooms, informational environment like posters and live displays, etc.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Tour factories and other specialized work facilities, like design studios or testing environments, at every opportunity possible. Ask operating staff as many questions as possible. Get enough engineering literacy to understand what you're looking at.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Pay attention to calendar management practices in client organizations, especially around senior executive schedules, and chat with admins whenever possible to learn the typical patterns of calendar craziness and how they cope.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Make all travel and site-visits count, but let your primary client gate-keep what's appropriate for you. Ask if they want you to meet with people you might not otherwise meet, and line up 1:1s.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Never be a "mysterious outsider" in an internal meeting. When sitting in/calling in on client meetings that aren't about your gig, always make sure someone introduces you, explains your presence, and says enough to put others at ease. And at least say hello.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: By default, do not bill for travel time unless you actually work on the gig on the plane/train. Bill a high-enough rate for billable time to cover overhead of travel-related schedule inefficiencies. Deal with exceptions like risky field travel case-by-case.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When you get a new lead, ask yourself whether one of your indie-consultant buddies might be a better fit for it than you, and refer them with a specific endorsement if so. Even if it means forgoing some short-term revenue yourself.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: In the indie consulting economy, cooperation is more important than competition. You're more likely to need support on skills you lack than to run into direct competition for a gig. So always look for ways to rope in buddies, and be open to being roped in.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Make all introductions (consultant to consultant, client to consultant, client to useful contacts) for free. Influence peddling for anything other than goodwill is rarely worth either the money or the moral hazard. Charge for what you know, not who you know.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Maintain a real blacklist and put people who behave poorly by your standards on it and stop working with them (both fellow indie consultants and clients). Indie consulting is a natural lemon market, and you are only as trustworthy as your network.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Make yourself a nice business card (from a service like Moo) with design and artwork that's meaningful to you. They're useless for networking but valuable catalysts for your identity formation as an indie consultant.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Don't network. Netplay instead. If it feels like conscious "work", you're doing it wrong. At best you'll gain short-term transactional benefits. Your network is ideally a positive externality of playing social games you actually take pleasure in.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Pay attention to the peripheries of your network. Your best leads will come from your weakest ties. People who know you best are usually your weakest sources of leads.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not book-keep time you devote to things viewed as goodwill (public commons contributions, free stuff, pro bono help to people who need it). Tracking means it is not coming from a place of abundance, and you will end up nursing a grievance about doing it.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: If it feels like thankless work, then you are unconsciously expecting to be thanked, even if you say you're not. Either charge for it, stop doing it, or structure it to accumulate value as an asset you control. Virtue signaling martyrdom is a dumb payoff.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Don't whine about being asked to work for exposure. Do it if it seems worthwhile, don't if not. Take note of those who exhibit exploitative patterns of trying to score free labor in return for worthless exposure, but you have no obligation to act on this info.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not act like you are in a union of exploited workers. The sine qua non of indie consulting is the search for greater individual agency than employees at any level from janitor to CEO can ever achieve. If that search doesn't interest you, do something else.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Maintain a clear sense of what "independence" means to you in relation to all levels of permanent employees. Independence from collectivist agendas is as important as independence from the whims of capricious executives or the blundering of clueless managers.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: "Watch for signs of holier-than-thou smugness in yourself in relation to paycheck types. Your role in the economy exists because theirs do. Your choice to be an indie consultant is just that: YOUR choice. Respect theirs."
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not get religious about the indie consulting life. You were probably a paycheck type once, and might be again. Or you might be part-time paycheck, part-time indie. The goal is to steadily increase individual agency over time, not cargo-cult religiosity.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Accept that you will often be misunderstood and viewed with suspicion by missionary types with a strong sense of belonging to organizations. Mercenaries have value precisely because missionaries suffer from loyalty blindness.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Google, learn about, and internalize Albert O. Hirschman's Exit, Loyalty, and Voice model. To be an indie consultant is to deeply internalize exit-oriented decision-making defaults.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Develop empathy and compassion for those with voice-oriented decision-making defaults, and learn to respect how and why they behave as they do, and how they serve as the yang to your yin. It takes both exit and voice types to make a world.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Turn public celebrations of freedom, such as July 4th (the US Independence Day) into private celebrations of your own. Take a moment to reflect on, and update, what freedom means to you. If your understanding of freedom isn't evolving, neither are you.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Employees need to get their head in the game, but consultants need to get the game in their heads. A good way to hone this ability is to read sectoral histories, biographies, and historical documents.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Take business cartoons like Dilbert, and workplace shows like The Office seriously. Your ability to get the jokes without being terminally depressed by them is a measure of your understanding of a work culture.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Learn to recognize common workplace watercooler versions of transactional games like "Ain't it awful?" and gently resist being drawn into them. They're a perk for employees, not you. Read Eric Berne's classic, Games People Play to learn the basic ones.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Examples, examples, examples. Your advice is only as good as your examples. Collect examples everywhere, from all sources. Half your value lies in being an encyclopedia of examples, with ready access to greater volume, velocity, and variety than employees.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: "Read up on classic/cliche examples commonly cited in your consulting niche, and have something fresh to say about them. Examples: Southwest Airlines (strategy consultants), iPhone (design consultants), AlphaGo (AI), BP futures (futurists)."
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Beware obscure, marginal examples unless they seem like portents of future megatrends. Obscure examples are the consulting equivalent of citing practices of isolated hunter-gatherer tribes in anthropology. Go for unfamiliar aspects of familiar examples.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not half-ass statistics as an element in anything you do, whether it's macroeconomic trends or A/B testing of UIs. Either go deep and do it right, or stick to narrative-mode justifications. Half-assed statistical thinking is often worse than none.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Try to be higher availability to longer-term clients. The better you know a person, the more valuable spontaneous or quick-scheduled conversations are to both of you (1 hour to 2 days out).
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Stay aware of the tempo of the engagement relative to the tempo of the normal workflows of the client. A weekly standing meeting with a client team that meets daily means up to 5 internal course changes might happen between your own updates.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Primum non nocere. First, be mostly harmless.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: You are likely just one source of counsel for your client. Learn about the other sources, and do your best to harmonize with them, but if you must pick a battle, do so as openly and directly as possible. Influence-undercutting games are rarely worth it.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Beware the boom-bust psyche, swinging between tactical hustling during cash-flow crunches, and coasting after a few good-sized invoices get paid.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Incorporate in the lowest-overhead way possible according to the laws of your country. In the United States, a single-member LLC is generally the appropriate vehicle.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Even if you're making very little money right now, keep your business and personal finances separate by opening a business bank account and credit card. It will make book-keeping and taxes vastly easier.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Give yourself a regular (preferably informal) "paycheck" via automated transfers from business to personal bank, but give yourself permission to modify amount/timing as needed. Best way to maintain a sense of cash flow predictability without being bound by it.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Hire a professional book-keeper the moment you can afford to. Not only will it take a chore off your hands, it will force you to learn minimum viable financial discipline in a way a janky spreadsheet and a shoebox of receipts won't.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Resist the urge to define what you're doing in general terms or come up with a clear elevator pitch too early. Wait till you've actually billed about 100 hours across at least 3 clients to take stock, otherwise you're theorizing your business in a vacuum.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Try and define what you do via negativa, by identifying things you won't do (or would rather not do except under significant financial pressure). Job descriptions are for employees.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: "Keep products — workshops, keynotes, training offerings — separate from, and subordinate to, your consulting work proper: Customized, personalized, bespoke services. If they start driving the action, you are a startup entrepreneur rather than a consultant."
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Avoid the trappings of full-featured corporations — office, mission statement, admin staff — unless you plan to scale from indie consulting to a partnership firm. For solopreneurs, if it's not billable, it's almost certainly low-leverage vanity overhead.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Partnerships are demanding relationships and fail more often than they succeed. Test any potential partner through a subcontracting relationship or small collaboration before committing to deeper/longer-term arrangements.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Figure out what tribe within a client company you're working for. It may not map to the org chart in obvious ways. There's usually at least 2 or 3 in a typical organization jockeying for relative power, and in some state between peace and war with each other.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Pay your own subcontractors as promptly as you can. Right after receiving their invoices if possible. Nothing breeds goodwill and trust like helping address other people's cash flow precarity when you can. Don't be like BigCos, paying as late as possible.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Keep your awareness of your own knowledge /ignorance up-to-date. If it's been more than a few years since you last worked on a type of problem, assume your understanding of it is worthless until you can convince yourself it is still good.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Beware the joyless cashflow grind of leads —> closings —> billings —> referrals/testimonials —> more leads. It feels like 100% of the game when you start, but if it stays that way, you will burn out. You are not an SEO/SEM automation script.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Reflect periodically on the proportion of your work that comes from following a client across roles/jobs, versus working with whoever is in a given role/job in an organization. Dog consulting vs. cat consulting.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: As an outsider in a client's world, you will hear a lot of jargon you can't parse. Pick your battles in asking clarifying questions vs guessing vs ignoring. A consultant who is constantly asking clarifying questions is too annoying to get to "useful".
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Beware of the Employee Orientation 101 syndrome where you get tempted into trying to learn your client's business the way new employees do. You'll learn the wrong things at very high cost. Hack your own way into an understanding that works for the gig.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Get good at picking up on clues about how a client business works indirectly, like a detective. Clients have problems they want solved. They're not tour guides.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When you have opportunities for discovery conversations with people at a client organization who are not primary clients you report to, make the most of it. Have good questions ready, that uncover information helpful for your gig. Try to be helpful in return.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: As an outsider, you will effectively be "borrowing" the status and authority of your primary client as you navigate the organization and talk to others. Behave appropriately, as a delegate of your primary, but do not abuse the borrowed social capital.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When talking to people who report to your client, put them at ease by clarifying the scope of what you're doing and why, and indicating clear boundaries for the conversation. But don't try to bond with them as a peer.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: In discovery, when people seem concerned about how what they're telling you will be used, just tell them. And ask if they'd prefer to act on their own judgment or want you to convey a message. Discovery chats with client employees are not interrogations.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: People tell outsider consultants things they wouldn't share with fellow employees. Respect the confidence, but gently set boundaries if they wander into inappropriate sharing that might put you in a tough spot. There are things it is better not to know.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When working with an organization, you will typically sign an NDA. But be aware that NDAs are just the baseline level of discretion you are legally bound to. You should hold yourself to much higher standards, including internally among company employees.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: In certain gigs, you may end up better informed than most employees, and keeping secrets between employees of the client organization may actually be a bigger challenge than complying with the NDA. Be on the alert for accidental internal indiscretions.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: If you bring a particular narrow technical background to a broader indie consulting domain, resist the temptation to apply it unless that's specifically what you're being paid to do. Use the background as a source of general principles, not specific skills.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: If you do not have the technical background to understand a deep technology underlying a client business, do not try to fake it. Play student, set boundaries. Fakery will be obvious to the experts long before you realize you're hemorrhaging credibility.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Try and land at least one gig in a new industry every year, no matter how small, and even if the work itself isn't new. As a consultant, your growth is a strong function of the frequency of sectoral boundary crossings you can sustain.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Even when you have a lucrative anchor gig going that's temporarily generating more than enough income, try and keep 1-2 smaller gigs with modest billings alive too. It's how you avoid cognitive capture by a single big client. Monogamy kills gig lives.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Differentiate your service offerings around what makes your clients special, rather than around what makes you special.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: On Labor Day, be polite and courteous to paycheck types, wish them a happy Labor Day, and make secret plans to turn all their jobs into some mix of apps, AIs, robots, and gigs for yourself.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Communicate with people you need to influence via the simplest and most informal medium possible that does the job.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Be liberal in the media you accept as input, and conservative in the media you select for output. You should be willing and able to process everything from screenshots of whiteboards to spreadsheets as input, but limit your output to 1-2 core media.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Include useful links inline, appropriately linked, in emails. As a consultant, LMGTFY (Let Me Google That For You) is a part of being effective.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Be conservative in who you cc on emails, especially when communicating with senior executives. Even an innocuous seeming cc may have chain-of-command implications, be seen as second-guessing someone, or undermine someone's authority.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Ambitious careerists may see other people's consultants, especially those supporting senior executives, as "access hacks" and try to tempt them into influence-peddling games. Gently but firmly discourage all such attempts by making your own boundaries clear.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Understand in what way you constitute a "secret weapon" for your client and either play that role to the hilt (heh!) or absolutely refuse to play it. Don't half-ass the role you're cast in.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Clients may invite you to internal events with a ceremonial/sacred aspect, such as awards ceremonies or celebration dinners, to be polite. But unless you sense they really mean it, you should decline by default.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Good organizations, especially small teams/workgroups, tend to foster an atmosphere of intimacy and trust internally, like a family. As an outsider, be sensitive to their "family time" needs and back off if you sense you are intruding.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not accept gifts from clients that are either too personal or too expensive. If it looks like role-appropriate schwag relative to internal peers, you're fine. Anything beyond that might mess with expectations/trust in subtle ways you probably don't want.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Watch for signs of transference. Indie consulting is similar enough to therapy that you may attract inappropriate attachments from clients. You are not a parent, spouse, or best friend. You are a professional associate and service provider first.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Understand the seasons of the sectors you serve, but make your own seasons. Do not take notions like "planning cycle" or "sales cycle" too seriously. They are for large organizations acting at scale, not individual free-agent operators.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Learn to operate inside the decision cycle (OODA loop) of the client, but like an attentive waiter or parent who can anticipate needs before the subject becomes aware of them, not as an adversary.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: "When engaging an individual of interest within an organization, take note of the dissonance between their operating tempo and that of the organization: Are they going with the flow, overtaking, pace-setting, or pace-disrupting?"
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Learn about the real history of an organization before attempting to understand its current state. Organizations have a tendency to present a timeless, ahistorical view of themselves that obfuscates unique traits under non-informative hagiography.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When designing and delivering workshops, decide upfront whether you're preparing an intervention for a specific situation or a performance of general interest. The two require incompatible strategies and trying to do both usually backfires.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When developing a repeatable workshop offering, use a sufficiently modular structure so you can customize it, and build in enough interaction so it is self-personalizing to context.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: If you get bored easily, do not try to develop repeatable, polished workshops where you expect the content to converge to 100% reusability within a few iterations. Allow yourself to mess around with the material as much as you like to keep yourself interested.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Do not pitch a workshop when it is not in fact the right way to solve the client's problem. Workshops are tempting because they seem like declining-cost/appreciating-value assets that compound in value with every delivery instance. This can be an illusion.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: To keep yourself honest, and avoid rent-seeking temptations, progressively transform valuable things you learn into the lowest-cost delivery medium possible. The first time you offer an insight/idea, it might be worth $1000, but the 100th time should be free.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: No matter how you drum up work, inbound leads almost always result in vastly superior gigs, so even if you start out with outbound, develop a plan to attract inbound.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: When you get a referral via a trusted friend or existing client, do not try to close the deal solely on the strength of their recommendation. Take the time to establish some direct trust with an exploratory conversation.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Use exploratory conversations to actually explore rather than sell or pitch your services. If you walk into a conversation unable to imagine any circumstances under which you might be the one to say "No", you're not actually exploring.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Learn to switch gears from exploring to closing gigs in a professional, courteous way. Cover all essential details — rates, contracts, NDAs — efficiently, without awkwardness or embarrassment. That can cause confusion, delays, and misaligned expectations.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Arrange to get paid in the lowest-overhead way possible. The best case is a client's admin using a corporate card to pay invoices online (the fee is worth it). The worst is a baroque vendor management system that might be so bad, it's a reason to refuse a gig.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Every now and then, take a moment to appreciate the fact that you live in an era where you can enjoy such a stimulating, enriching, varied, and free-ranging working life. Thanks to the internet, we have access to a kind of deep fun few in history have had.
  - author: venkatesh-rao
    tip: Never forget that the future of work is already here, and you're it. You're a pioneer. Act like one.
