	Project boxes display project summary information, similar to member
	cards. As with member cards, they can be presented either as links
	or containers, but unlike member cards their "link form" is their
	primary use case (containerized project boxes are used for "coming
	soon" projects).

	This include takes a single parameter, `project`, which should be
	an object containing the relevant project information from
	`site.pages`.

	Note that this widget outputs HTML in a safe way, and is thus
	suitable for inclusion in both Markdown and HTML pages.
