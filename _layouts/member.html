	Template for individual member pages; inherits from the "page"
	template. Applied to data files from the `members` category.

	Generate the `member_id`. We'll need it later.

	Pull in the member card (which functions as an information box
	here, rather than a link).

	Generate a list of projects that the current member (1) was a lead
	on or (2) was a collaborator on.

	We begin by creating two arrays to hold these lists. Liquid lacks a
	way to natively create empty arrays, so we `split` an empty string
	instead. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

	Then, we loop through the `site.projects` collection. So long as the
	project is not in the future, we check to see if the current member
	is a lead editor or a collaborator and add them to the appropriate
	array (`projects_lead` or `projects_collaborated`).

	Adapted from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/42727933

	Output the `projects_lead` and `projects_collaborated` arrays.
{% endcomment %}
{% if projects_lead.size > 0 %}
	<h2 id="project-lead">Project Lead On</h2>

{% comment %}
	Include any writings for the current member.

	Note that, since the post list widget only outputs Markdown, we
	can't include it directly. Instead, we capture its output and then
	transform it into HTML using `markdownify`.
