{{ content }}

{% comment %}
	A layout that doesn't do anything. Useful to set as the default so
	that we can process JavaScript, CSS, JSON feeds, RSS feeds, and
	other files through Jekyll without messing up their structure.

	(We place {{ content }} first, as otherwise XML documents -- which
	can't begin with a blank line -- will fail to parse.)
