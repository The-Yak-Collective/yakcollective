{{ content }}

{% comment %}
	Sometimes you need a layout that doesn't do anything.

	Used to provide an empty "layout" for JavaScript, CSS, JSON feeds,
	RSS feeds, and other files that need to be processed but aren't
	actually HTML.

	(We place {{ content }} first, as otherwise XML documents -- which
	can't begin with a blank line -- will fail to parse.)
