description: How can I possibly untangle this mess?

He looked down in pain at his programmable forearm tattoo[^1] after finishing his last note. The microbots in his arm etched a new web of nodes mirroring his note taking system on Roam. His mind had become a mess since his father's death and now it was reflected on his arm for all to see. "How can I possibly untangle this mess" he thought to himself.

He had tried everything, even subscribing to the "Love the Land"[^2] program sponsored by the state. The people from the LLE (Love the land enforcement) had taken away all his electronic devices and internet connected implants and put him on a homestead 150 miles west of Austin in the West Texas desert. There, every evening he looked at the wind turbines lined across the entire horizon and wondered when his mind would cease to become an endless loop of the same thoughts going round and round.

Now, he was swiping through the Perfect Father app that his friend had suggested as something he could try. He eventually ended up hiring an older man with a slightly disappointed resting face as his father. Rather than this being a sado-masochistic experience, it so happened that Mr.Vader, the man he hired to be his father is actually a pretty decent indie-life coach. Mr.Vader introduced him to the concept of "reparenting". The act of imagining being a parent to your younger self, the way you would have liked to be parented and coached. He had always thought of himself as the son who never lived up to his father's expectations but oddly enough Mr.Vader had made him realize that this aggrandizing, hypercritical inner self that he had acquired during his formal years was kind of a drag. But, now he was angry at his dead father.

He decided to feed the memories from his iRemember account that collected artefacts from his life and his own Roam notes to GPT-51 which accurately represented his father, except for the occasional off hand complement which he hated. He found yelling and getting extremely angry at GPT-51 to be surprisingly cathartic, kind of like an escape room experience but for relationships.

Today, he was browsing through the App Store and found that GTP-51 PREFAB FATHER was not the top selling app this month. He looked down at his forearm tattoo, which right now resembled the beautiful constellations he observed on that dreadful Love the Land escapade, and thought "Who knew you could be rich from your trauma."

[^1]: A programmable forearm tattoo controlled by micro bots who can add and remove ink dynamically. It connects to the API of your personal note taking system. As you take notes and develop original ideas, the tattoo adds or removes nodes. Like the Roam node graph, but visible on your forearm. You can write your own CSS to style the tattoo as you wish. Expansive node graphs and original styling are highly respected as publicly visible performances of knowledge work.

[^2]: **Love The Land:** A return to simpler times, this federal campaign advertises the joys of simple life -- work the land and grow your own crops, disconnect from technology. Some  take this earnestly and reconnect to growing their own food, others take it as permission to make love on the land, creating delightful 60's era 'make love' communes.
