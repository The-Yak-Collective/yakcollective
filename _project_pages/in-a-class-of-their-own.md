"Goddammit, Judd, why is your Clarinet-MLv2 in pieces in the garage! How are you going to get into the AllStateJuniorRonaldMcDonaldPeabody Conservatory with a broken Machine Learning Clarinet[^1]? Don't you want a break from all this homeschooling to make some new friends in meatspace?”

"Shhh!" Judd holds his finger to his lips emphatically. Looking nervously over his shoulder while shunting his father to the corner of the garage away from the decomposed Clarinet, he whispers, "It was already on the fritz, Dad. No matter what I played, it kept repeating the same thing.”

Judd mockingly adopts the calm, slightly patronizing/British tone of Clarence, his AI-assisted music instructor:  “My algorithm finds that you are currently at the 46th percentile amongst clarinetists in your peer competition group. Practice your arpeggios and improve your score before the final evaluation! 16 year-olds in your city with finely articulated arpeggios are generally ranked in the top quartile. Add a strong swing-eighths style and you could be in the top decile. Say 'practice arpeggios' or 'practice swing-eighths' for a lesson”

Judd continues, "And I mean, No. Matter. What. I. Play. I practiced my arpeggios for 2 hours and it tells me 46th percentile and practice arpeggios. I play a series of high-pitched squeals. 'My algorithm finds that you are currently at the 46th percentile" blah, blah, blah. I even take it apart and remove the analog-to-digital converter and feed it recordings of whale sounds or Benny Goodman for 15 straight hours. And every time the same thing: "You're at the 46th percentile, and you need to practice your arpeggios." Judd throws up his hands excitedly.  

"I thought it was busted. But then things got weird. On a lark, I decided to feed it the [most mysterious song on the internet](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/most-mysterious-song-on-the-internet-885106/), you know that one that aired on German Public Radio before the fall of the Berlin Wall? Clarence hears that austere Deutsche New Wave and, for once, he's speechless. There's a looong silence. And then: 'Tell me what you want.'"

“And, you want to know the weirdest part?” Judd pauses dramatically before leaning in and whispering even more quietly than he had been, "Clarence says it with no accent."

His father looks over Judd's shoulder at the dismembered Clarinet with, as the commercial advertisements would claim, "Built-in machine learning software that provides personalized teaching and testing with no dangerous human interaction necessary!"

"Well, what did you ask for?"

...

Judd looks at his father like he’s got two-heads, "I asked for more advice on my arpeggios! I really, really want to get into AllStateJuniorRonaldMcDonaldPeabody Conservatory."

[^1]: A clarinet children have to use during national examinations to earn highly prestigious grade certifications. There's no examination proctor. Passing/failing exam is entirely judged by a machine learning system baked into the instrument that calculates their score by comparing the student's performance to other children taking in that same year.

[^2]: **Hygiene 3.0:** A post-pandemic hygiene 3.0 world, where people across all different types of relationships touch each other far less and generally keep a higher level of distance between one another. Personalised biotechnology continues to develop at a rapid rate as triggered by the pandemic, to serve the purpose of maintaining personal health/hygience. Social norms of a disciplinary nature develop around this.

[^3]: **Hyperpersonalised homeschooling kit:** A kit of hyper personalized learning tools based on quantified activity from the previous year. This could be subjects, training for specific activities etc. coincides with increase in homescholling.
