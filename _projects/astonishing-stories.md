summary: |
  The upside of an extremely uncertain environment is that we have been free to purely indulge in speculation about the future. The result is _Astonishing Stories_, an anthology of short speculative fiction developed from the networked thoughts of over 30 indie consultants. 

  Our working process is open and visible to all on our [Roam graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/graph). The future fragments were developed by Indie consultants from different industries and experience levels through playing sessions of [_The Thing From The Future_](https://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/). The fragments provided a jumping off point for authors of short speculative fiction and can be used by anyone to develop stories of their own or speculate on the post-COVID world.

  The stories here are not meant to predict the future but to be imagination extenders for entrepreneurs and consultants navigating a post-COVID landscape.
