summary: |
  Is that an observation or a diagnosis? Engage! I don't have a life. I have a program. That was awfully close. What if you killed me? What makes you think I wasn't trying? If you hear muffled screams, consider that a request for a beam out. Is something wrong? Yes. Terribly wrong.
  
  Your brain is not on file. I must prove to him that persistence is futile. It's like being pecked to death by ducks. You punch like a Ferengi. Well, let me guess! You're either lost, or desperately searching for a good tailor. "Impossible" is a word that humans use far too often.
