## What is the New Old Home?

1. Work used to take place in the home. 
2. Then it traveled out into the world with the male breadwinner. 
3. Now work has come back home again... but obviously things are much different. 

_The New Old Home_ is a look at some of the converging trends shaping homes in the post-COVID world; as we return to an older way of doing things, with an eye towards how to integrate the lessons we've learned.

### A Small Caveat...

This goal of this deck is to imagine a "model home" that takes into account changing technologies, remote knowledge work, social/isolation needs, and care tasks.

_Model homes_ are slightly-aspirational visions for the middle class: a backyard with a white picket fence in the suburbs, a fancy condo in the city. 

In reality, homes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. **The future homes of the marginalized working class, as well as wildly opulent homes of the ultra-wealthy and other unusual living situations, are not fully explored in this document.**

Nevertheless, we hope that some of the ideas in this deck are relevant to everyone as we look forward towards the future of our living spaces.

## The Yak Wisdom Project

This deck is the **second** in a series of studies the Yak Collective is undertaking over the coming months. If you find this report interesting, be sure to check out our first, [_Don't Waste the Reboot_](/projects/dont-waste-the-covid19-reboot). We aim to generate a body of Covid-19 reboot intelligence that is fundamentally different from anything you might see anywhere else, not just in terms of content, but in terms of the process of getting to it.
