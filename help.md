## How workflow works

Each of us has our own consulting practice or small freelancer business, but we also work together on larger projects -- and we want to do more of that. We range in experience from newbies who have yet to make their first buck from indie work, to veteran hustlers with long-established independent practices who have already billed thousands of hours and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars through independent consulting work. 

Our members are from all over the world: The Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. 

Our politics range from anarchist and socialist to unrepentant neoliberal shilling and classical-liberal business conservatism. 

Our approaches are diverse, and we mean **really** diverse: our membership includes hard-headed sociopath types as well as sensitive artist types, and every other type in between. We count both head-in-the-cloud philosophers and roll-up-sleeves doers in our ranks. 

Our functional experience spectrum ranges from industrial R&D and software development to marketing and anthropology.  **What allows this to work is that we've been building our network the old-fashioned way: by earning each other's trust in the slowest, most reliable way possible -- one small collaborative effort at a time.**
