      The Yak Collective is a group of independent consultants who coordinate
      loosely on gigs, and collaborate on larger gigs. We are a varied bunch
      with a very diverse set of experiences.<br><br>We are available both for
      individual projects on specific topics that match our skills, and larger
      collaborative projects we can take on as a group, bringing together the
      mix of skills necessary.
