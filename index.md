# The Yak Collective

The Yak Collective is a network of over 300 independent consultants, coaches, and freelancers with varied technical and creative skills. You can learn more about us on the [About page](/about). We are available both for individual projects on specific topics that match our skills, and for larger collaborative projects we can take on as a group, bringing together the mix of skills necessary. Check out our [Members page](/members), read some of our latest thoughts on the [Writings page](/writings), and get in touch with any of us if you'd like to learn more.

Our inaugural report, *[Don't Waste the Reboot](/projects/dont-waste-the-covid19-reboot)*, is now available. Check it out! We will be releasing more research on the [Projects page](/projects) in the coming months.

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yak_collective), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theyakcollective/), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yak-collective/) to stay in the loop.
