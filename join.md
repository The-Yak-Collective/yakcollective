# Join the Yak Collective

The Yak Collective is an online space for collaborative tinkering towards a post-[Weirding](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/harambe-the-perfect-meme/498743/) world with an emphasis on doing over talking. You can learn more about the what, why, and how on the [About page](/about.html).

If this interests you, take a moment to read our [code of conduct](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/CF_GEWrWq) before joining, and then answer a couple of simple questions (all <span class="required">*</span> fields are required) to access our Discord link.

_If you are already a member, you can update your profile anytime in the [Yak Member Portal](https://yak.knack.com/yaks#yak-profile/)._
