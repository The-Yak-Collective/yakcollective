# Join the Yak Collective

The Yak Collective is an online network for independent consultants, contractors, and gig-economy types. We are focused on working together in larger teams to produce collaborative work, both internally initiated and for clients. We use [Discord](https://discord.com/), a tool built around voice and text chat channels, as our main work platform. Most of our work process and chats are open to the public.

Be sure to take a moment to read our [code of conduct](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/i92e8kE2x) before joining.

To access the invitation link for our Discord server, please answer a couple of simple questions (all <span class="required">*</span> fields are required).

(If you are already a member, you can update your profile anytime in the [Yak Member Portal](https://yak.knack.com/yaks#yak-profile/).)
