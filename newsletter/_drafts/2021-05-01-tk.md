We're starting with ClaimClam, a fun consumer web app that aggregates & automates claim filings for existing class action settlements (think AirHelp/MainStreet/TurboTax for claim filing). There's about $20 billion in ~$5/10/20 checks that almost no one is filing claims for; ClaimClam redistributes corporate dollars and helps people collect on money owed to them.

We can discuss something like "PM should use emails" at the meeting, vote on it, and then 1 person is charged with writing the "majority opinion" and dissenters can choose to add "minority opinions."
