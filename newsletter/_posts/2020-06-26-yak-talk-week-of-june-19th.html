<p>As we meander through <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/129-gray-sunset">the doldrums of the pandemic</a>, the general mood of many, irl and online, seems to be a two-fold acceptance of current events. <br><br>One, that the pandemic has cozily settled in for the summer, bringing with it second wave of infections and deaths(you could also argue that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/12/876224115/coronavirus-second-wave-nope-were-still-stuck-in-the-first-one">the first never left</a>).<br><br>Two, an (even deeper) entrenchment of precarity, which was sufficiently dire for many, pre-COVID. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/">40+ million Americans have filed jobless claims in the past 10 weeks</a>, with predictions bordering on the apocalyptic when additional $600/week unemployment benefits end in July. The premature openings of many service businesses will likely have disastrous results for owners and employees as well.</p><p>That said, the online economy continues to go brr.</p><p>For indie consultants, uncertainty and precarity often provide rich opportunities to make sense of prevailing big moods(<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/big-moods-little-moods">and unarticulated little moods, as well</a>), helping clients cultivate an <a href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/34-the-difficulties-of-not-knowing">uncertainty mindset</a>, and managing newly-remote teams, and organizations.</p><p>With this in mind, in upcoming weeks, Yak Talk will turn it&#8217;s focus towards sharing how <em>we </em>work, as a decentralized collective of independent consultants.</p><p>Specifically, we will share strategies and tactics with regards to how Yak generates, coordinates, and ships projects. Expect insights on managing decentralized teams, and otherwise productively reacting to &#8220;being thrown into distributed chaos&#8221;.</p><p>How are you efficiently managing your distributed groups?
