<h2>&#8220;The Dog Daies&#8221;</h2><p>It&#8217;s been a relatively quiet week at Yak as we lope into the Dog Days of Summer: Pandemic Edition.</p><p>Historically, the &#8220;dog daies&#8221;, as medieval scribes called them, begin on July 3rd, and coincide with the time of the year when the Sirius<em> </em>star system appears to come closest to the sun. The name Sirius comes from Homeric Greek, referring to "Orion's dog".</p><p>To the ancient eye, this seemed to be the reason summer was the hottest at this period: the brightest star in the night sky at it&#8217;s closest point to the sun, augmenting the power(read: <em>the heat</em>)of the sun. In fact, <em>Sirius</em> is 8.7 light years away.</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-1024-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https&#x0023;3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e728051-8d48-460f-9586-936e82647420_3573x2512.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e728051-8d48-460f-9586-936e82647420_3573x2512.jpeg" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e728051-8d48-460f-9586-936e82647420_3573x2512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4713164,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007d;" alt=""><style>
