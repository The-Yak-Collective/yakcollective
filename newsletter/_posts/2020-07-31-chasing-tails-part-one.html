But even when the experts <em>are</em> present, the ROI is usually marginal and rarely meaningful.</p><p>The world is complex and always in flux, much like how our environment is perturbed due to the COVID pandemic. The many variables of our world&#8212;and their interconnectivity&#8212;make it difficult to reliably predict higher order effects. Even experts, who are great at analysing the &#8220;what,&#8221; misstep when considering unfolding events and interaction effects. </p><p>Never doubt human ingenuity, though...</p><h3><strong>What&#8217;s In a Tail?</strong></h3><p>The tail of a distribution refers to the events or outcomes that aren&#8217;t expected to happen.&nbsp;</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-1092-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https&#x0023;3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ae83d3a-85aa-4e0d-b5bb-62c447607de7_1600x1200.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ae83d3a-85aa-4e0d-b5bb-62c447607de7_1600x1200.png" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ae83d3a-85aa-4e0d-b5bb-62c447607de7_1600x1200.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007d;" alt=""><style>

        </style></a><p>In many situations, the unlikeliness of these tail occurrences makes testing and exploring their effects implausible. But with the democratization of simulation technology, methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics">systems dynamics</a> can be used to <a href="https://seths.blog/2013/09/edgecraft-instead-of-brainstorming/">edgecraft</a> situations, generate ideas, and chase tails. Absurd questions will be asked and tentative possibilities will be born. But who is likely to chase such tails?&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Creatives, certainly.</strong> A novelist whose story involves a state shutting down internet access in a population centre would no longer have to guess how many people are needed to spread a message via a mesh network. They could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_simulation">toy with the network parameters</a> and adjust the story accordingly.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Amateurs and hobbyists, too.</strong> There&#8217;s no rule that says experimentation requires a hypothesis. Once the tools are available, people will use them in unpredictable ways to do unexpected things. There will be a simulation modelling equivalent of <a href="https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Internet%20Toaster">a toaster on the internet</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Individuals, teams and organisations</strong> that want to go in the direction of <a href="https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/rough-consensus-and-maximal-interestingness/">maximal interestingness</a>.</p></li></ol><p>The latter class of tail-chasers is who we are going to focus on over the next few weeks. We&#8217;re going to look at some example applications of simulation models in different contexts and see how they can be used to ideate and imagine alternate realities.&nbsp;</p><p>(P.S.
