This makes it easier to learn and stay engaged. However, it&#8217;s also easy to get lost in the conversation; the format is very fluid.</p><p>It&#8217;s not just me.&nbsp;Both the interviewer and interviewee find themselves lost periodically. You&#8217;ll hear phrases like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s put a pin in it for now,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Let&#8217;s revisit this&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ll get to this point soon, so let&#8217;s hold off for now.&#8221;</p><p>This is the result of many simultaneous ideas (and their relationships) causing us to hit a cognitive ceiling. It&#8217;s difficult to hold it all in your head.</p><p>Stephen C. Levinson articulates this well in the abstract of&nbsp;<a href="https://dyslectern.info/2016/01/01/complexity-of-conversation/">Turn-taking in Human Communication - Origins and Implications for Language Processing. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2015</a></p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Most language usage is interactive, involving rapid turn-taking. The turn-taking system has a number of striking properties: turns are short and responses are remarkably rapid, but turns are of varying length and often of very complex construction such that the underlying cognitive processing is highly compressed.</em></p><p><em>The bulk of language usage is conversational, involving rapid exchange of turns. New information about the turn-taking system shows that this transition between speakers is generally more than threefold faster than language encoding.</em></p><p><em>To maintain this pace of switching, participants must predict the content and timing of the incoming turn and begin language encoding as soon as possible, even while still processing the incoming turn.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;This intensive cognitive processing has been largely ignored by the language sciences because psycholinguistics has studied language production and comprehension separately from dialog.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><a class="image-link image2 image2-527-619" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https&#x0023;3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6a6bdbd-591b-419d-819e-c617b6f3f776_619x527.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6a6bdbd-591b-419d-819e-c617b6f3f776_619x527.png" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6a6bdbd-591b-419d-819e-c617b6f3f776_619x527.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:527,&quot;width&quot;:619,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007d;" alt=""><style>

And I think we can draw inspiration from messaging interfaces to form a framework for what a solution could look like.</p><h3>Introducing Pins</h3><p><em>The podcast&#8217;s flow of conversation mustn&#8217;t be interrupted. </em>Interruptions void trains of thought that otherwise would have been fleshed out. The solution needs to be mostly automated to retain text and context, therefore preserving as much&nbsp;<em>&#8220;meaning&#8221;&nbsp;</em>as possible. I'm imagining a messaging interface where the words are transcribed live on screen and who said what is visually denoted.<br><br>For example, think about a traditional messaging format.</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-365-521" target="_blank" href="http://a9.io/glue-comic/"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9afd0e4-4c22-4a94-9ede-5f1166b02647_1414x990.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9afd0e4-4c22-4a94-9ede-5f1166b02647_1414x990.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:990,&quot;width&quot;:1414,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:521,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;http://a9.io/glue-comic/&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;http://a9.io/glue-comic/&quot;}" alt="" title="http://a9.io/glue-comic/"><style>

It's common for speakers to want to do this, too.</p><p>Remember our phrases, like &#8220;Let&#8217;s put a pin in that&#8221;? We need a functionality that allows participants to denote a single thought or collection of thoughts. Something like, &#8220;I have something to say on that last statement, but I think we should come back to it later.&#8221;<br><br>The pin should be short; only 3-4 words, not unlike a sticky note you would write for yourself. The pin is a reminder to return to the conversation and context that led up to that point. <em>It indicates an open loop</em>. The pin should also provide enough context to re-prompt the speaker to expand on it later in the conversation. We want to retain both the &#8220;meaning&#8221; of the thought in that particular moment <em>and</em> have an external memory that reduces cognitive load.</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-508-401" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55d75d4d-953b-47bf-b908-f04d170cc85b_1016x1286.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55d75d4d-953b-47bf-b908-f04d170cc85b_1016x1286.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55d75d4d-953b-47bf-b908-f04d170cc85b_1016x1286.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1286,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:401,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;http://a9.io/glue-comic/page-2&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="" title="http://a9.io/glue-comic/page-2"><style>
