<p>Reminder, the annual meeting of the Yak Collective will be held <strong>tomorrow,</strong> Thursday December 10th at 8 AM Pacific. It&#8217;s a public Zoom event, so do drop by if you&#8217;re curious to hear what we&#8217;ve been up to and what we are hoping to do next year. We&#8217;ll talk old projects, new projects, our rapidly evolving infrastructure and production capabilities, </p><p>Here is the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=NWoyOThhOWVtNWg1ZzlnMmtrYTZ0ZHNscTEgbzk5NW00MzE3M2Jwc2xtaGg0OW5tcnA1aTRAZw&amp;tmsrc=o995m43173bpslmhh49nmrp5i4%40group.calendar.google.com">public calendar invite</a>.<br><br><strong>Topic: </strong>Yak Collective Annual Meeting and Holiday Party<br><strong>Time:</strong> Dec 10, 2020 08:00 AM Pacific Time (US and Canada)<br><strong>Zoom Meeting:</strong> https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87558263911<br><strong>Meeting ID:</strong> 875 5826 3911</p><h1>Astonishing Story</h1><h2>Mechanical Turks All the Way Down</h2><p>I  jabbed the accept button on one of the many touch surfaces that  suddenly popped into reality in my shared office, home, and daycare.  Can&#8217;t be too eager on your first day of the job.</p><p>There was a low  din of my five-year-old arguing again about what xe would or would not eat for breakfast. Thank god for the AR distraction-canceling face mask.  It was cranked up to 98% reality canceling. With it on I could safely  ignore the mounting skirmish between little Tovio and my partner.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg" width="1440" height="1440" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1440,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mechanical Turks All the Way Down&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007d;" class="sizing-normal" alt="Mechanical Turks All the Way Down" title="Mechanical Turks All the Way Down" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09018843-eafb-4d60-a82a-de64fdfa4616_1440x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Illustration by <a href="https://www.yakcollective.org/members/thelot-justice/">Justice</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This  was my second job today. A basic anniversary gig like I&#8217;d seen in the  training. There were a lot of notes and I quickly scanned them for any  red flags, but accepted immediately. Taking jobs fast shows good  teamwork which means my teamwork score goes up which, algo willing, will  lead to more lucrative jobs.</p><p>If I&#8217;m not in the algo&#8217;s top tier,  we can&#8217;t afford the next level of healthcare we need. The raw number of  medical claims sitting in my personal email could be felt through the  unread count floating above it. Inhalers, lung rehabilitation  treatments, microextracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines. The list  doesn&#8217;t end.</p><blockquote><p><em>Next week is a special anniversary of  working for my principal. He is middle-aged (36) and works at a  mid-sized company. He has most recently purchased a new pair of shoes,  some weekly groceries, and a measles-mumps-rubella-ebola-coronavirus  home booster immunization kit. I want it to be really special. He tends  to enjoy things like cold food, travelling alone &#8212; not sure if by design  or low desirability &#8212; and collecting little AR-tagged stickers from his  travels. More than anything he is striving to be more efficient in his  life and get more out of it.</em></p></blockquote><p>It went on and on like that.</p><p>For  a second I felt that I was lost daydreaming. It wasn&#8217;t that I was  daydreaming and zoned out &#8212; even though it said a lot, the message  didn&#8217;t say much.</p><p>The final comment was unexpected:</p><blockquote><p><em>How do I know that you are a person or a machine?</em></p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>Was  this a corp test? How did I know this requester was a real person? I&#8217;ve  been warned by a friend who also works this gig that they will slip  these in every now and then to make sure I&#8217;m not using personal algos to  do my work.</p><p>While I was trying to orient myself, three windows  filled with top-10 lists for presents for managers of 3 to 5 years. One  window included a sock collection that matched shoes this group had  bought, another popped up a guided meditation app focused on dealing  with the uncertainty of life, and the third suggested a wine-flavored  powdered alcohol collection of the best wines ever made.</p><p>The sock collection had already been suggested to the client by the algo.</p><p>How  uninspired. Just like I expected. I also felt a teeny bit thankful.  These uninspired suggestions were why I had a job in the first place.</p><p>The client apparently felt the same, adding to the channel:</p><blockquote><p><em>Your suggestion is highly predictable. Our models output the same ranking.</em></p><p><em>We  are looking to expand past our current bottleneck. The requirement of  novelty is high for this principal. Churn is highly likely without a  high-importance gift.</em></p></blockquote><p>I dictated quickly based on the training I had just received:</p><blockquote><p><em>I  know it feels unnatural. The important part is that you are asking  these questions. We show care by doing these actions even if they aren&#8217;t  100% by ourselves.</em></p></blockquote><p>The display flashed an icon to be more casual. I continued:</p><blockquote><p><em>Just  think about all the times we&#8217;re saving people from horrible arguments.  That reduces everyone&#8217;s suffering. The authenticity is that you care.</em></p></blockquote><p>An immediate reply:</p><blockquote><p><em>Acknowledged. What is your recommendation? On standby.</em></p></blockquote><p>This  reply made me pause in thought again. Am I helping someone&#8217;s machine  buy themselves a gift? Is there solidarity between people and machines  working the same gigs? Is this like training my replacement? Or being a  slave to a machine? At least more of a slave than usual.</p><p>The  system dinged at me that I was taking too long. I had half a mind to  sabotage this job in some way. I remembered the company had a one-strike  law for &#8220;conspiring against the machines.&#8221; We jokingly referred to it  as the <em>Terminator Law</em>.</p><p>The requestor pinged at the same time:</p><blockquote><p><em>The optimal time to get this to them will be within the next hour and thirty-five minutes. Acknowledge?</em></p></blockquote><p>I said as fast as I could:</p><blockquote><p><em>I  recommend the Chupa Chups reproduction taste machine. It gets at  something that your &#8216;principal&#8217; posted a long time ago in the archives.</em></p></blockquote><p>It was a long-shot item on the list that the system had spit out with low confidence and high uncertainty.</p><p>I got a quick reply:</p><blockquote><p><em>Your  follow up suggestion was not the highest confidence score for a gift.  If I boost that original memory, it will change the ranking. It scores  very high on nostalgia for my principal.</em> &#128588;&#128073;&#128072;&#128126;&#128158;</p></blockquote><p>It left a bunch of gibberish in the chat, but then who knew:</p><blockquote><p><em><code>eNo1zEEOgzAMRNGrzFXYsOISJJliSxAjx2ng9kWV2P//JrglCxy9BSzxRghhXugNm35ZoYF0Q/qxViRq3Rp4ZZ6BIXSi9SzvMazvBdnqZ9f8BBryB2f1x1/W8QMJXSke</code></em></p></blockquote><p>Machines are weird.</p><p>The  channel was closed, the Chupa Chups machine was ordered, a card was  generated with some pithy platitude appropriate for the situation, and a  star was added to my budding virtual jar.</p><p>Another job flashed on  the surface immediately. I accepted it eagerly to push off the questions  that arose in people helping machines help people.</p><p>While starting  to scan the details, a part of my mind was stuck on the last job. I  wondered when the bots could better calculate human behavior and  recommend the same tasteful gifts as I did. Maybe the novelty of a  minimum viable human picking gifts would wear off.</p><p>Then I had to turn up the distraction cancellation as I could hear the breakfast ordeal escalating.</p>
