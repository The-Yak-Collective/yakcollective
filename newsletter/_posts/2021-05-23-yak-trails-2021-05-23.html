If you&#8217;re any flavor of indie consultant and not yet a Yak Collective member,&nbsp;<a href="https://yakcollective.org/">check us out</a>&nbsp;and consider&nbsp;<a href="https://yakcollective.org/join">joining us here</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>#yak&nbsp;rover project updates</strong></h4><p>The Yak Rover project is an effort by Yak Collective to create an open-source rover design capable of being deployed on Mars by 2031. We are betting that radically declining launch costs and increasingly capable infrastructure on Mars and the Moon (such as shared communications relay or charging facilities) could open up the possibility of an open-source space program based on low-cost rovers. Weekly standing calls on Mondays include quick status updates on: last week&nbsp;<strong>lw</strong>, next week&nbsp;<strong>nw</strong>, blockers&nbsp;<strong>bl</strong>, and one interesting thing&nbsp;<strong>oit</strong>.</p><p>The Yak Rover project includes five independent rover builds. <br>fmi: <a href="https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/yak-rover/">Yak Rover Project</a></p><p><strong>Infinity and Beyond</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Based on the ESA model rover</em><br><strong>lw</strong>. Flew beyond outside just before Ingenuity&#8217;s flight (yay).<br>Printed the bogie bearings.<br><strong>nw</strong>. Play with RISC-V board<br><strong>oit</strong>. Need to add new camera with pan-tilt to drone to see what is below the drone, since the drone-camera is fixed to the body and looking forward</p><p><strong>Go and See</strong>.&nbsp;<em>A pair of simple PiCars</em><br><strong>lw</strong>. Tried to get the new ultrasonic sensor working on the first PiCar and failed. Tried to connect a different camera to the first PiCar and realized I'll need to create a mount for it in order for that to work well enough. Continued assembly of the second PiCar.<br><strong>nw</strong>. Finish assembly of the second PiCar and get all of the sensors and other features working.</p><p><strong>Nature is Murder</strong>.&nbsp;<em>A from-scratch rocker-bogie design</em><br><strong>lw</strong>. Learned basic motor control circuits<br><strong>nw</strong>. Design a simplified chassis just for motor testing<br><strong>oit</strong>. Components not sitting properly on breadboards is like the most likely error always</p><p><strong>Abio Flex Wanderer</strong>.&nbsp;<em>A spider-bot</em><br><strong>lw</strong>. Play with sensor candidates to mount, including a thermal camera, an optical range finder, a laser range finder, a new camera, and seeing though ABS and acrylic.<br><strong>nw</strong>. Start implementing a software watchdog<br><strong>bl</strong>. Work for food stealing work for good.<br><strong>oit</strong>. Pondering a simple question: What does it mean to go forward? The problem is to find an abstract and meaningful API to command a rover to go forward (same question then for any action). The question seems trivial until considering different rovers. Wheels, legs, spheres, etc. Aside different servo commands, it is unclear to me what other data this API needs, what options, and what feedback it should provide. Example of distance forward as a feedback is hairy: Absolute distance is inaccurate, legged rovers usually have gait that makes vague actual distance. Anyway, this is the kind of polish I am trying to apply with the BOS API for rover commands.</p><p><strong>Wonderful Wandering Growth</strong>.&nbsp;<em>A spider-bot</em><br><strong>lw</strong>. tried to figure out the outdoors image quality problem<br><strong>nw</strong>. see if i can use some type of AGC or maybe glasses to reduce light levels and maybe help with the blooming problem. if time permits, start on some type of image processing and maybe look up a suitable SLAM<br><strong>bl</strong>. only %life</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1165-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833f3aee-e4a1-48e5-bae5-f99981488e23_2000x1600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833f3aee-e4a1-48e5-bae5-f99981488e23_2000x1600.jpeg" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/833f3aee-e4a1-48e5-bae5-f99981488e23_2000x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1165,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:334936,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Yak Rover example images&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007d;" alt="Yak Rover example images" title="Yak Rover example images"><style>
