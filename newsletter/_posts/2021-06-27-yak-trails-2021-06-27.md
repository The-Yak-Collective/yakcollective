A mostly automated roundup of what the Yak Collective was up to this week. Yaks can [jump on the server](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877) to join in. If you’re not yet a member, [consider joining](https://yakcollective.org/join).

## channel activity

[Astonishing Stories.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709768319108120636/857270681091702804) Fiction study group that occasionally publishes speculative fiction

[General Discussion.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877/858006265582190622) I’m looking to assemble a computing reading starter pack that contains, at most, 10 books. Assume, say, an undergrad level of familiarity with computer science and programming. What ten texts are up for inclusion? / Anyone interested in a decentralized finance study group? thinking about starting one up / Anyone interested in regular weekly coworking sessions?

[Infrastructure.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/704369362315772044/858029500901097533) how hard would it be to write the readingadd url list to a spreadsheet? reflecting on the governance chat exercise we just did, starting to summarize/tag a year’s worth of readings to make a summary whitepaper, it strikes me that piping link shares into a spreadsheet creates a very useful starting point in general, for many accumulating value conversations

[New Old Home and Country.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709753766076874774) Making a call for interesting case studies in the emergent roles & projects spun up or faltered during the course of the pandemic. This would begin as a slide presentation just like last year’s [The New Old Home](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home/) and could go for there to multimedia formats.

[Online Governance Studies.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709454740614021121) Today‘s coworking session on the 6-pager. Agenda: 10 minutes reading, 10 minutes comments, 40 minutes working on the spreadsheet together (should be obvious what we‘re trying to do from the spreadsheet, but I‘ll provide some direction). But just for fun, we'll also do a very quick reading/discussion too of a very relevant article, as we attempt to do this... [Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia - Cory Doctorow](https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm)

[Philosophy.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/702921068834324710/857969644948946955) we are currently on hiatus; I'll have a time confirmed this week for the beginning of the next which will be early July

[Quantum Computing](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/855077891347054652/855078058617077780). Would anyone be interested in a project or study group on quantum computing? I don’t have a specific direction in mind, but with tools like Qiskit [https://qiskit.org/](https://qiskit.org/) it looks not so hard to play around and do something interesting.

[Yakfit.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/809318532990500865/857271503175548970) Exploring wearables and fitness goals for yaks.

[This week‘s meeting notes.](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/gh_Aa0Thx)

**Nature is Murder.** Got started on CAD model of the actual final design, ordered a bunch more goodies. Boot up the BBBlue and get to led blink on it. CAD is an REPL even though it doesn't look like it

**Wonderful Wandering Growth.** debugged video source duplication (for streaming, dual access to images) and googledrive and twitter integrations. wrote some underlying code for twitter usability. finish tweepy based twitter integration. using tools/libraries with version 0.X is "fun"

**Abio Flex Wanderer.** Tentative coding on BOS to cover goal modeling and planning in the bot. The context is for the bot to "discover" what to do when it cannot progress (e.g. never walked up stairs, how to). Continue on BOS tentatives, and complete what I could not this week on the OAK-1 camera. Remote access to the bot is down, and I lost my opportunities this week to deal with the OAK-1 configuration. A discussion with Maier on my work compared my approach to SLAM (the now famous problem definition). In fact this work could be seen as some form of SLAM for concepts/knowledge. Tentatively calling it CLAM.

Hehe triple-hybrid test assembly: CAD printout, pen lines on paper, some actual components. This could be an art form.
