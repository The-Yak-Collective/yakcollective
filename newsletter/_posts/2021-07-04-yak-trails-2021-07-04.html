Get to first servo control test on the board. Driver snafus under MacOS Catalina so having to use my wife's Macbook on High Sierra. Realized that embedded software ecosystems evolve much more slowly than personal computing. Many things are years old. You're living in slower time.</p><p><strong>Abio Flex Wanderer.</strong>&nbsp;Fix integration of OAK-1 on the bot. Now available on a /dev/videoX file, for working with Maier's Twilio tools. BOS software only, focusing on what we now call "situation construction". OAK-1 works with v4l2 now, but then we cannot leverage its compute and ML capabilities. For that I need to switch it to its specific XLink interface, usable from Python or C++. This may be a permanent limitation, according to the maker (not an issue, because v4l2 is just for video, whereas XLink allows new use (current understanding)). In the BOS software trials---aimed at a toolkit for autonomous rovers---I have plans for several complementary components. I have come to realize recently that "situation construction" can be quite useful to many, aside components for "driving" or ML for example. This could be a good opportunity for contribution. This is also complementary with recent discussions on multi-compute rover software.</p><p><strong>Infinity and Beyond.</strong>&nbsp;Print the head. Print the final parts. Play with Beyond SDK. Learn more about video editing. check overhangs while printing, otherwise a repeat print is needed. better to print without overhangs</p><p><strong>Stubborn.</strong>&nbsp;Completed a rewire of the rover. After a lot of precision soldering I have proper connectors and a much more reliable rover. I'm exploring swapping out my ground station Arduino with a raspberry pi. This would provide some interesting potential for connecting the rover up with the world. My latest Adafruit order brought me a little camera I want to play with as well. Seattle heat wave has impacted productivity. After rewiring the rover the motors seem to be operating with a lot less resistance. So much so that it runs faster and it had to be re-tuned. I had no idea how much it had been suffering.</p><h2>Channel activity</h2><p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709768319108120636/857270681091702804">Astonishing Stories.</a>&nbsp;Fiction study group that occasionally publishes speculative fiction.</p><blockquote><p>based on the last infra call I've come up with an outline for project managing the editing process for stories. I think it would be nice to have a bot that sends notifications on this channel when a story moves from one stage to another, including details of who moved it. Idea would be that once a story is submitted, anyone can pick it up for editing/review/proofreading. And kind of like github it is up to the author to decide whether to accept the changes and move it towards publishing. Can join the infra call this week and explain further.
