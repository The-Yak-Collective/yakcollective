A mostly automated roundup of what the Yak Collective was up to this week. Yaks can [jump on the server](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877) to join in. If you’re not yet a member, [consider joining](https://yakcollective.org/join).

## Yak Rover updates

The Yak Rover project — a project to design a real Mars rover prototype that can actually be built and trialed on Earth, and evolved into a production model that could potentially even be launched to Mars. [Roam](https://tinyurl.com/roamh1/191?_Yak_Rover).

[This week‘s meeting notes - How and why I connected Wonderful Wandering Growth to the world.](https://ipatent-co-il.zoom.us/rec/play/gcUfRMdk4WyAaknoJPLk-6EPaLe3kmga8X3gw7ONq1VhB-U7e4hz6s5MCiJE0F-5nQpTPKg7ALibXKvc.leCDkfrg2wU5t7zn?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=rqxYEQxJQhauxFG20XRrsw.1625422801755.8e12920971fdfd876150a91042f89e34&_x_zm_rhtaid=418)

**Nature is Murder.**  Finally booted up the Beaglebone Blue and configured it and got to led blinking. Get to first servo control test on the board. Driver snafus under MacOS Catalina so having to use my wife's Macbook on High Sierra. Realized that embedded software ecosystems evolve much more slowly than personal computing. Many things are years old. You're living in slower time.

**Abio Flex Wanderer.**  Fix integration of OAK-1 on the bot. Now available on a /dev/videoX file, for working with Maier's Twilio tools. BOS software only, focusing on what we now call "situation construction". OAK-1 works with v4l2 now, but then we cannot leverage its compute and ML capabilities. For that I need to switch it to its specific XLink interface, usable from Python or C++. This may be a permanent limitation, according to the maker (not an issue, because v4l2 is just for video, whereas XLink allows new use (current understanding)). In the BOS software trials---aimed at a toolkit for autonomous rovers---I have plans for several complementary components. I have come to realize recently that "situation construction" can be quite useful to many, aside components for "driving" or ML for example. This could be a good opportunity for contribution. This is also complementary with recent discussions on multi-compute rover software.

**Infinity and Beyond.**  Print the head. Print the final parts. Play with Beyond SDK. Learn more about video editing. check overhangs while printing, otherwise a repeat print is needed. better to print without overhangs

**Stubborn.**  Completed a rewire of the rover. After a lot of precision soldering I have proper connectors and a much more reliable rover. I'm exploring swapping out my ground station Arduino with a raspberry pi. This would provide some interesting potential for connecting the rover up with the world. My latest Adafruit order brought me a little camera I want to play with as well. Seattle heat wave has impacted productivity. After rewiring the rover the motors seem to be operating with a lot less resistance. So much so that it runs faster and it had to be re-tuned. I had no idea how much it had been suffering.

## Channel activity

[Astonishing Stories.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709768319108120636/857270681091702804) Fiction study group that occasionally publishes speculative fiction.

> based on the last infra call I've come up with an outline for project managing the editing process for stories. I think it would be nice to have a bot that sends notifications on this channel when a story moves from one stage to another, including details of who moved it. Idea would be that once a story is submitted, anyone can pick it up for editing/review/proofreading. And kind of like github it is up to the author to decide whether to accept the changes and move it towards publishing. Can join the infra call this week and explain further. ([#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709768319108120636/858765400756846642))

> EXPERIMENT Created [#bot-testbed](app://obsidian.md/index.html#bot-testbed) so that yaks can play with bot commands without feeling like they are cluttering up a channel. tk: master doc of yak bot tricks. Commands need to be a standalone post to fire.

May lead to gigs for YC member or YC in general. [Roam](https://tinyurl.com/roamh1/194?_Yak_Coffee).

> Agenda:  
> YakC to drive team formation and team gigs, herds, imagined as opt-in to a small team that wanted to offer similar services together. might be multiple herds on overlapping topics. id  **68**  
> what's our stack for the Yak Cafe service? profiles for yaks, for team conversations, for scheduling, for calls, for coordination messaging? id  **72**  
> what's the workflow/ux for Yak Cafe lifecycles? for yaks to profile themselves and leave, to define cafe groups for conversation and suspend/end the group, to join a group or leave a group, to initiate a conversation with a cafe group and get trickle notifications before and after. id  **73**  
> what are blanket ToS for Yak Cafe for the yaks and for guests? id  **74**

[General Discussion.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877/858835041747861564) A place to chat about anything and everything you might find interesting or relevant.

> re stretching the airport metaphor that reminds me of several sci fi stories like Station 11 or films where people get stranded in an airport in a post-apocalyptic or other scenario. There's also the incredibly true story of all the planes on 9/11 that got routed to that obscure Canadian airport that used to get tons of transatlantic traffic in the pre jet era but then was a minor pitstop thereafter until 9/11 happened. There's a play about the quiet heroism of the town to shelter, feed and take care of everyone during that crazy time. Cool story and well done. Perhaps [worth a gander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_from_Away) if you're looking for inspiration to flesh out the metaphor a bit more ([#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877/858896504104943647))

> Is there anything happening beyond white papers and press releases though? The ESG wave is taking a stronger hold over the earth observation / data analytics orgs a lot too. But I haven’t come across much beyond vague gesturing at climate change. ([#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/725542427229945877/860056964892590101))

[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/sXVqH6H4T). Standing calls Wednesdays 11am ET

> My top action items for today's call... Yak trails -- should Yak trails experiment continue? - Want to offer to stand aside for someone else to take the reins for July. - It's still pretty manual for now. In Substack will always be. Buttondown offers the automaticity we are looking for (maybe Mailchimp too). - Would be interested to continue if one of our API-understanding yaks wants to team up, now or in August? ([#](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/704369362315772044/859795428144971796))

[New Old Home and Country.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709753766076874774) Making a call for interesting case studies in the emergent roles & projects spun up or faltered during the course of the pandemic. This would begin as a slide presentation just like last year’s [The New Old Home](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home/) and could go for there to multimedia formats.

[Online Governance Studies.](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/709454740614021121) A place for discussing ideas about governance of communities, collectives, networks, etc. We take a somewhat scholarly approach to discussions. Friday 9 AM PT governance chats here on the voice channel. [Roam](https://tinyurl.com/roamh1/193?_Yak_Collective_Governance)

> Today's agenda: 1. Short reading (5+5min) 2. Review/summarize 2 old readings in spreadsheet (same as last week) (20 min) 3. NEW activity! Insight extraction (20 min) a) a "log line" (tldr) of the year's readings, b) a "high concept" (the big insight that pulls the themes together. [Here's the reading](http://www.scriptsecrets.net/tips/tip59.htm), it should only take like a minute or two.

> discuss a mechanism for publicizing things that require no new infrastructure or project-like work, but just a clear statement of recommended behavior on a key point. Like a "best practice note" or "fatwa" or "supreme court opinion". This might actually be a way to build up a proper Yak Handbook, as a set of case-law type opinions. We can discuss something like "PM should use emails" at the meeting, vote on it, and then 1 person is charged with writing the "majority opinion" and dissenters can choose to add "minority opinions." Maybe in the announcements channel or a separate new policies channel. id  **36**

> interactive serendipity engine for yc. We had a good governance chat today around serendipity in interactive social e-commerce and an idea came up — can we build something like an interactive serendipity engine for yc. Something timeboxed and curated like a periodic hackathon or “festival” or “farmers market” but for production/participation rather than consumption/shopping. id  **27**  
> discuss whether to have yaks offer packetized work services a la fiverr, operating yak as a platform. So combining vertical, type, and format as a crisply defined, fixed-price, fixed-schedule, specific inputs-outputs product. $95 for a 20 minute coffee zoom to talk over a tactical execution problem in your healthcare technology digital transformation project. id  **34**

Off to an inauspicious start with the Beaglebone Blue. The network drivers won’t install on MacOS Catalina. Apparently the packages, HoRNDIS and EnergiaFTDIDrivers (no idea what they do… ELI5?) do shady shit at system level so Catalina sez no.

github copilot has, by their own admission, been trained on mountains of gpl code, so i'm unclear on how it's not a form of laundering open source code into commercial works. the handwave of "it usually doesn't reproduce exact chunks" is not very satisfying

Some thoughts about Github Copilot and copyright (I am not a lawyer). Copilot uses a version of GPT3 trained on GPL licensed code. GPL give everyone the right to copy and make derivatives. Derivatives inherit GPL. Copilot can sometimes memorize and repeat snippets of code.
