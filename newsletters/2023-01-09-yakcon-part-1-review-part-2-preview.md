- **YakCon Part One is done!** We had around thirty participants (+/- 5) for the full four-hour session. If you missed it, but still want to attend Part 2, read on to get caught up, and look for the sign-up link at the bottom.

## Part 1 Review

- There was a mixture of active and inactive Yaks, as well as some newcomers; approx. 40% of attendees were new to YC or returning from a hiatus.

- The consensus is that the 4-hour session just whizzed by. Here's a recap that may indicate why.

- Now, we're into YakCon's Async Week. Below is a breakdown of what's happening.

## **Async Week Activities**

- **Distributed systems and robotics**

- **Governance studies**

- **The Fermi Gym**

- **Infrastructure**

- **YakFit**

- ​_**You'll need access to the YC Discord to take part in any of the above. Go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to get it.**_

## Towards YakCon Part Two

- After Async Week, we get to **YakCon Part Two.**

- It follows the same structure as Part One (and it's at the same time; **1600 UTC this coming Sunday, January 15** ), and it will be friendly to those who missed Part One and/or Async Week. **We'll have two guest speakers for this session, though.**

- We'll be hearing from **Mike Casey** ([Farcaster](http://fcast.me/mc), [personal site](https://mcasey.xyz/)). He specialises in investment and entrepreneurship in complex markets facing capital scarcity — whether that's by geography (think Africa) or vertical (think life sciences). He'll be tackling the difficult question: "Can Crypto Close the $4 Trillion SME Financing Gap?"

- We'll also be hearing from **Dan Grover** ([personal site](http://dangrover.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangrover/)). Dan—designer, engineer, entrepreneur—will be exploring the possibility that simulation games might be what the world needs right now.

- Sounds good, right? So get to it. **Register for YakCon Part Two [here](https://lu.ma/yakcon) and go [here](https://www.yakcollective.org/join.html) to access to the YC Discord.**
