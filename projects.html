	Generate two arrays: The first of already-published projects
	(`published_projects`), and the second of upcoming projects that
	have been loaded up in the website but are not quite ready to "go
	live" (`upcoming projects`). We reverse-sort both of these so that
	the most recent most recent most recent projects are listed first
	(Jekyll does this automatically for posts, but not for any other
	collections).
{% endcomment %}
{% assign published_projects = site.projects | where_exp: "project", "project.date <= site.time or site.future == true" | reverse %}
{% assign upcoming_projects = site.projects | where_exp: "project", "project.date > site.time and site.future == false" | reverse %}

{% comment %}
	List the three most recent *published* projects.
{% endcomment %}
<section>
	<header><h2>Latest Projects</h2></header>
	{% for project in published_projects limit: 3 %}
		{% include project-box.html is_link=true project=project %}
	{% endfor %}
</section>

{% comment %}
	List all upcoming projects.

	We don't link upcoming projects, both because they're, well, not
	ready yet, and because Jekyll won't publish collection pages from
	the future by default (nor would we generally want it to in
	production).

	List all other projects (e.g., all published projects *except* the
	three most recent).
