At a certain time, in a certain space, a person may speak or act and find himself under a recent form of judgment: cancellation.

Indeed, this algorithmic tribunal stands watch over many, many occurrences and its decrees hold unforeseen consequences. Those people, those consequences, still navigate day-to-day life but haven’t the chance to go back or go forward.

This growing body of consequences now finally sees a new option, an outlet for moving forward. A select team, carrying rites handed down by religious sects, futurists, and ancient literature, service a series of practices. They elucidate practicable ways: making amends, settling disputes, and beginning again for a new time and place.

This Department of Restoration achieves a plane never before seen. The department will have many adherents because, as they say, we are always on trial. They say this will be the end of forgiveness as we know it.

One mustn’t trust the above in the same manner that we would dismiss a man made of cobwebs.

No effort could deplete the delicate, extending arms of misfortune. Room after room, gesture after intolerable gesture, the department will become bailiffs and stenographers in an ever more complex milieu.
