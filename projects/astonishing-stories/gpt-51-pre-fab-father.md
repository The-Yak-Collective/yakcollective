# GPT 51 Pre-Fab Father

He looked down in pain at his [programmable forearm tattoo](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/6jX2RXOls) after finishing his last note. The microbots in his arm etched a new web of nodes mirroring his note taking system on Roam. His mind was a mess since his father’s death and now it was reflected on his arm for all to see.

“How can I possibly untangle this mess?” he thought to himself. He had tried everything, even subscribing to the [_Love the Land_ program](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/b0JBkV_8Q) sponsored by the state. The people from the LLE (Love the land enforcement) had taken away all his electronic devices and internet connected implants and put him on a homestead 150 miles west of Austin in the West Texas desert. There, every evening he looked at the wind turbines lined across the entire horizon and wondered when his mind would cease to become an endless loop of the same thoughts going round and round.

Now, he was swiping through the Perfect Father app that his friend had suggested as something he could try. He eventually ended up hiring an older man with a slightly disappointed resting face as his father. Rather than this being a sado-masochistic experience, it so happened that Mr. Vader, the man he hired to be his father, is actually a pretty decent indie-life coach. Mr. Vader introduced him to reparenting: Imagining being a parent to your younger self, the way you would have liked to be parented and coached. He had always thought of himself as the son who never lived up to his father’s expectations, but oddly enough Mr. Vader had made him realize that this aggrandizing, hypercritical inner self that he had acquired during his formal years was kind of a drag. But, now he was angry at his dead father.

He decided to feed the memories from his [iRemember](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Astonishing_Stories/page/1uBQxh_pw), an account that collected artefacts from his life, and his own Roam notes to GPT-51, which accurately represented his father (except for the occasional off hand complement which he hated). He found yelling and getting extremely angry at GPT-51 to be surprisingly cathartic, kind of like an escape room experience but for relationships. On a drunken whim one night, he decided to submit his prototype to the app store, in case another lonely soul happened to need it.

Today, X months later, he was browsing through the App Store and found that GTP-51 PRE-FAB FATHER was now the top selling app of the month. He looked down at his forearm tattoo, which right now resembled the beautiful constellations he observed on that dreadful Love the Land escapade, and thought “who knew you could become rich from your trauma?”
