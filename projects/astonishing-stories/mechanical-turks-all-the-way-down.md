# Mechanical Turks All the Way Down

I jabbed at the “accept” button on one of the many touch surfaces in my shared office, home, and daycare. Can’t be too eager on your first day of the job.

There was a low din of my five year old arguing again about what they would or would not eat for breakfast. Thank god for the dynamic distraction canceling face mask. With them on I could safely ignore the mounting skirmish between them and my partner.

This was my second job today. A basic anniversary gig like I’d seen in the training. There were a lot of notes. I quickly scanned for any red flags but accepted quickly. This should help increase my teamwork score which, algo willing, will lead to more lucrative jobs.

If I’m not in the top tier we can’t afford the next level of healthcare we need to make it through another fire summer and its corresponding respiratory issues.

“It is a special anniversary of working for my principal. They are middle aged (36) and work at a mid-sized company. They have most recently purchased a new pair of shoes, some weekly groceries, and a MMREC home booster immunization kit. I want it to be really special. They tend to enjoy things like food, travel, and collecting little items from their travels. More than anything they are striving to be more efficient in their life and get more out of it…”

It just went on and on like that. It was saying a lot without really saying much about the person getting the gift.

The final comment was alarming:

“How do I know that you are a person or a machine?”

Was this a corp test? How did I know this was a real person? They try to slip these in every now and then to calibrate and make sure I’m not using personal algos to do my work.

While I was pondering this, three of the screens filled with top 10 lists for presents for managers of 3-5 years. It included a socks collection that matched the shoes they had bought, guided meditation app focused on dealing with the uncertainty of life, and wine-flavored powdered alcohol collection of the best wines ever made. The top item of one of the lists had been sent to the client already by the algo.

How uninspired.

The client felt the same when adding to the channel: “this seems really uninspired. Our models would have predicted the same ranking.”

They continued: “We are looking to expand past our current bottleneck. The requirement of novelty is high for this principal. Churn is highly likely without a high importance gift.”

I typed quickly based on the training I had just received: “I know it feels unnatural. The important part is that you are asking these questions. We show care by doing these actions even if they aren’t 100% by ourselves.”

The display flashed an icon to be more casual. I continued: “just think about all the times we are saving people from horrible arguments. That reduces everyone’s suffering. The authenticity is that you care.”

“Acknowledged. What is your recommendation? Thread lock initiated. On standby.”

Am I helping someone’s machine buy themselves a gift? What would be the impact if I did recommend the wrong thing? Is there solidarity between those working gigs?

It made me pause in thought again. Lots of existential questions. The system dinged at me that I was taking too long.

The requestor pinged at the same time: “The optimal time to get this to them will be within the next hour and thirty-five minutes. Acknowledge?”

“I would recommend the Chupa Chups reproduction taste machine instead. It gets at something that your ‘principal’ posted a long time ago in the archives.” It was a long shot item on the list the system had spit out with low confidence and high uncertainty.

“This was not the highest confidence score for a gift. If I boost that original memory it will change the ranking. It scores very high on nostalgia for my principal. 🙌👉👈👾💞”

The last thing it left was “0” which was a very machinery way of saying goodbye.

The channel was closed, the Chupa Chups machine was ordered, a card was generated with some pithy platitude appropriate for this situation, and a star was added to my budding virtual jar.

Another job flashed on the surface immediately. I accepted it eagerly to push off the questions that arose of people helping machines help people.

While starting to scan the job details I had to turn up the distraction cancelation as I could hear the breakfast ordeal escalating.
