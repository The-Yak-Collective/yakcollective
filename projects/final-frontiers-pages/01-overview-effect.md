The cognitive shift astronauts report having from looking upon Earth from its orbit. Coined in 1987 by Frank White.

> “You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty.” — Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14

## Ivory Tower Overview Effect

By the year 2050, over 1 million humans had experienced some form of the Overview Effect. While technology allowed for high fidelity optics simulating this voyage from earth to space, those who actually experience the Overview Effect attest that there is no substitute for the real experience. Somewhat contradictorily, this increase in exposure seemingly kick started a collective cognitive shift to address the existential threats facing man and the planet, while also creating a castelike division between those who had experienced the Overview Effect first hand, those who had experienced a manufactured form of it, and those yet to experience it in any fashion.

## Minimum Viable Overview Effect

Those who had experienced the Overview Effect first hand from space were driven to re-create this phenomenon without having to leave Earth. This push led to experimentation with a combination of immersive experiences and nootropics, resulting in a minimum viable Overview Effect and other tangential experiences. Now, certain combinations still create an expanded consciousness, but also have unique characteristics from the space bound approach. For example, swimming with whales fosters a sense of empathy you likely will not achieve in Space. While, this option is still not widely accessible to broad populations, in 2050, more Overview options are available to humans than ever anticipated previously.
