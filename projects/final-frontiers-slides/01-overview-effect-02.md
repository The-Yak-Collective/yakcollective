By the year 2050, over 1 million humans had experienced some form of the Overview Effect. While technology allowed for high fidelity optics simulating this voyage from earth to space, those who actually experience the Overview Effect attest that there is no substitute for the real experience. Somewhat contradictorily, this increase in exposure seemingly kick started a collective cognitive shift to address the existential threats facing man and the planet, while also creating a castelike division between those who had experienced the Overview Effect first hand, those who had experienced a manufactured form of it, and those yet to experience it in any fashion.
