Those who had experienced the Overview Effect first hand from space were driven to re-create this phenomenon without having to leave Earth. This push led to experimentation with a combination of immersive experiences and nootropics, resulting in a minimum viable Overview Effect and other tangential experiences. Now, certain combinations still create an expanded consciousness, but also have unique characteristics from the space bound approach. For example, swimming with whales fosters a sense of empathy you likely will not achieve in Space. While, this option is still not widely accessible to broad populations, in 2050, more Overview options are available to humans than ever anticipated previously.
