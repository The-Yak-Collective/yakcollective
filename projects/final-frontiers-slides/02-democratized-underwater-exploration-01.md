Consumer-priced ocean exploration products are just beginning to emerge, creating unprecedented opportunities for democratized participation in oceanic exploration.

The development is similar to the impact of low cost, high power amateur telescopes (such as large aperture Dobsonian telescopes) in amateur astronomy.

Companies like Sofar (created via merger of OpenROV and Spoondrift) now offer consumer-priced oceanic exploration gear capable of serious research and exploration activities. But the stack required for true democratization remains incomplete.
