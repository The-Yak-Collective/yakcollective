**Consumer-scale products** have limited range, endurance, depth limit, modest sensor payload, low autonomy capabilities, and a limited stack.

**Bespoke research equipment** like the MBARI _Tethys_ (right) are capable of long range endurance missions and are supported by a deeper stack of support technologies.
