- **Political:** How do amateurs enter the playground of militaries and commercial shipping?

- **Economic:** How do amateurs meet the high costs of staging deep ocean exploration?

- **Socio-cultural:** The oceans are a wilderness, how do you build a cultural foundation?

- **Technological:** How to build the capabilities, which are much deeper than other amateur fields?

- **Legal:** Can amateurs handle lawless international waters and regulation choked territorial waters?

- **Ecological:** Will amateurs help protect threatened marine ecosystems or become part of the threat?
