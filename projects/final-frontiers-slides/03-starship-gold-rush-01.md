**Starship’s success fuels a new space ‘gold rush’ in 2030.**

- $/kg, cost to orbit: **Ariane 5** — $8,000
- $/kg, cost to orbit: **Starship** — $300

- **Political:** The US gains a significant advantage over China, wholly outcompeting them in access to space

- **Economic:** SpaceX monopolises launch.  Launch tech innovation ends.  New space entrepreneurship explodes

- **Socio Cultural:** Space tourism, for the wealthy, booms.  Libertarians agitate for orbital settlements, free of control.

- **Ecological:** Space debris rapidly accumulates.  Thankfully, Kessler events are prevented due to tech and regulation

- **Technological:** Space tech surges, especially in resources and manufacturing.  Collaboration doesn’t.

- **Legal:** The US forges ahead with new legal structures for space, forcing UNCOPOUS to adapt.
