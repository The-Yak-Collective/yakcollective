Consumer-priced ocean exploration products are just beginning to emerge, creating unprecedented opportunities for democratized participation in oceanic exploration.

The development is similar to the impact of low cost, high power amateur telescopes (such as large aperture Dobsonian telescopes) in amateur astronomy.

Companies like Sofar (created via merger of OpenROV and Spoondrift) now offer consumer-priced oceanic exploration gear capable of serious research and exploration activities. But the stack required for true democratization remains incomplete.

## The Capability Gap

**Consumer-scale products** have limited range, endurance, depth limit, modest sensor payload, low autonomy capabilities, and a limited stack.

**Bespoke research equipment** like the MBARI _Tethys_ (right) are capable of long range endurance missions and are supported by a deeper stack of support technologies.

## Dimensions of the Capability Gap

- **Political:** How do amateurs enter the playground of militaries and commercial shipping?

- **Economic:** How do amateurs meet the high costs of staging deep ocean exploration?

- **Socio-cultural:** The oceans are a wilderness, how do you build a cultural foundation?

- **Technological:** How to build the capabilities, which are much deeper than other amateur fields?

- **Legal:** Can amateurs handle lawless international waters and regulation choked territorial waters?

- **Ecological:** Will amateurs help protect threatened marine ecosystems or become part of the threat?
