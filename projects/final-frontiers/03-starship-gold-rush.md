- **Political:** The US gains a significant advantage over China, wholly outcompeting them in access to space

- **Economic:** SpaceX monopolises launch.  Launch tech innovation ends.  New space entrepreneurship explodes

- **Socio Cultural:** Space tourism, for the wealthy, booms.  Libertarians agitate for orbital settlements, free of control.

- **Ecological:** Space debris rapidly accumulates.  Thankfully, Kessler events are prevented due to tech and regulation

- **Technological:** Space tech surges, especially in resources and manufacturing.  Collaboration doesn’t.

- **Legal:** The US forges ahead with new legal structures for space, forcing UNCOPOUS to adapt.  

## The Coldest War, 2030

In the first year of this new decade, the US has gained strategic control of the orbital environment, as well as tactical control of Shackleton Crater on the South Pole of the moon. This crater, with both the largest amount of water ice on the moon, and peaks of eternal light, enables them to crack water ice into rocket fuel, further consolidating their dominance over the cislunar sphere.

China predictably responds in kind, expanding their lunar base, and our orbital environment is becoming increasingly militarised.  

Europe and Russia are working together to restrain the expansion of these superpowers, with little success so far.
