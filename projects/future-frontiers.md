summary: |
  When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records. Madness has no purpose. Or reason. But it may have a goal. Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Human beings do not survive on bread alone ... but on the nourishments of liberty. For what indeed is a man without freedom ... naught but a mechanism, trapped in the cogwheels of eternity. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Without freedom of choice there is no creativity.

  A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. Live now; make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. Change is the essential process of all existence. Human beings do not survive on bread alone ... but on the nourishments of liberty. For what indeed is a man without freedom ... naught but a mechanism, trapped in the cogwheels of eternity. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing. Without freedom of choice there is no creativity.

## Genius Doesn't Work on an Assembly Line Basis

Did Einstein, Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, 'Today I will be brilliant.' Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing. Live Long and Prosper. Nuclear Wessels!

A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on. When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. Khaaannnn!

Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Change is the essential process of all existence. Without followers, evil cannot spread. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
