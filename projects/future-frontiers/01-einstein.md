# Einstein

A library serves no purpose unless someone is using it. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently. Leave bigotry in your quarters; there's no room for it on the bridge. Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns. Resistance Is Futile! For everything, there is a first time.

You may find that having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but it is often true. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross; but it's not for the timid. Perhaps man wasn't meant for paradise. Maybe he was meant to claw, to scratch all the way. Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose -- and excluding that which is painful. Resistance Is Futile!

Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, 'Today I will be brilliant.' Beam Me Up, Scotty! You've never really faced death, have you?" "...No; not like this. I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing.

... the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. The intellect is not all... but its cultivation must come first, or the individual makes errors... wastes time in unprofitable pursuits. Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' ...Message, Spock?" "...None that I am conscious of -- save, perhaps, for 'Happy Birthday.'

Insults are effective only where emotion is present. Without followers, evil cannot spread. He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round Perdition's flames before I give him up.
