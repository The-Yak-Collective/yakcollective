From James P. Carse's [_The Religious Case Against Belief_](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL12433661M/The_Religious_Case_Against_Belief), pages 80 - 81:

> Frontiers are essential food for the psyche, for a species with the temporal imagination to see past the limits of individual mortality. Frontiers are spaces where moving towards horizons results reliably, if not predictably, in encounters with novelty. And it is the endless supply of novelty flowing across the frontier horizons of humanity that makes it possible to play what philosopher James Carse called the infinite game, where the goal is not to win, but to continue the play.
