# Kazanga

They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round Perdition's flames before I give him up. ...Warp speed.

What makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, and irrational fear of the unknown. There is no such thing as the unknown. Only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns. Live Long and Prosper. No, Kirk, no. You'll not escape. From hell's heart, I stab at thee. ...For spite's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.

I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. A library serves no purpose unless someone is using it. They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  I speak of rights! A machine has none; a man must. If you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine; indeed, you have elevated that machine above us!  To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness -- from within -- and from without. It's hard to believe that something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.

... the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently. In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. Your will to survive, your love of life, your passion to know ... Everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed to you. Those are the qualities that make a civilization worthy to survive. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior -- mentally or otherwise. Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns. Live Long and Prosper. Beam Me Up, Scotty! For everything, there is a first time. No, Kirk, no. You'll not escape. From hell's heart, I stab at thee. ...For spite's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.

Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on. When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. Now, I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love, when every day is a struggle to survive. But I do insist that you do survive, because the days and the years ahead are worth living for!  Beam Me Up, Scotty! Nuclear Wessels!
