The modern-age space industry has long been dominated by major global superpowers. Today nanosatellites offer significant promise for **developing nations to engage with the space industry on their own terms, in a way that directly benefits _their_ populations**. Domestic universities, public sector bodies and businesses can begin to come to grips with space tech without necessarily turning to wealthier nations to ‘import’ relevant technological insight and expertise. Younger generations pursuing interests in space will also have increased opportunities to realise these interests at home, rather than abroad.
