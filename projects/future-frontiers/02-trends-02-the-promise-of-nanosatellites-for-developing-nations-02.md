In 2017 the Federal University of Technology in **Nigeria** launched the **Nigeria-Edusat-1**. The objectives for Nigeria were to increase their scope for space education, capture low/high res photographs of the country and improve measurements of atmospheric density.

In 2018 the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in **South Africa** launched the **ZACube-2**. The objectives for South Africa were to monitor their natural resources and enhance communication services.

The nanosatellite launch rate is expected to continue growing, signalling a move away from the elitist and unrestrainedly expensive routes that have been the mainstay of the industry. Developing nations will be able to capture a small percentage of this continued growth, gaining access to space in the way that Nigeria and South Africa have successfully been able to do.
