Nanosatellites shift the power dynamics of space exploration by transforming it into a truly multi-actor field. Developing nations can partake in a variety of political alliances that form exclusively across the space industry in a similar way to existing economic/trade alliances.

Those which rely heavily on natural resources will benefit from nanosatellite data, e.g. understanding how rapid growth in human populations could impact agricultural and geological spaces. Improved signal monitoring will help navigate the impact of natural disasters and support effective relief mobilization. Developing nations will also start to leverage their data/expertise/manufacturing capacity emerging from nanosatellite usage.
