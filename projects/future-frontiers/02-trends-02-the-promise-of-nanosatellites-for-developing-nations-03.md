Nanosatellites shift the power dynamics of space exploration by transforming it into a truly multi-actor field. Developing nations can partake in a variety of political alliances that start to form exclusively across the space industry in a similar way to existing economic/trade alliances.

Those which rely heavily on natural resources will benefit from nanosatellite data e.g. understanding how rapid growth in human populations could impact certain agricultural/geological spaces. Improved signal monitoring will also help navigate the impact of natural disasters and support effective relief mobilisation. Developing nations will also eventually start to leverage their data/expertise/manufacturing capacity emerging from nanosatellite usage.
