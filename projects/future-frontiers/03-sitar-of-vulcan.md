# Sitar of Vulcan

I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing. Live now; make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. I've done far worse than kill you. ...I've hurt you; and I intend to go on... hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. ...Buried alive; buried alive....

With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably. When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records. Insufficient facts always invite danger. Insults are effective only where emotion is present. In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. Live Long and Prosper. Beam Me Up, Scotty! I've done far worse than kill you. ...I've hurt you; and I intend to go on... hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. ...Buried alive; buried alive....

It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross; but it's not for the timid. They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You remove those obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness -- from within -- and from without. He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round Perdition's flames before I give him up.

I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing. You may find that having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but it is often true. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  Without freedom of choice there is no creativity. Make It So! It's a -- far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before; a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known." "...Is that a poem?" "...Mmm. Something Spock was trying to tell me -- on my birthday.

... the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. It's hard to believe that something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.
