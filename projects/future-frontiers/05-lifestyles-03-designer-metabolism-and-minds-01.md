description: Develop the science and tech of designing multiple viable human metabolisms for traveling to and living on Mars by 2040.

[Human hibernation](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-09575-2_199-1) was required for humans to go beyond exploration into settling phase on Mars. Successful hibernation required hacking human metabolism. Impact: Increased longevity and well being for all. The key driver was to make human hibernation a large scale human metabolism R&D / hacking project, rather than a space project. Multiple viable designs of human metabolism generated new ways of being human that made neuroscience of 2020 a quaint specialization.

_Exploring the Human frontier. We are already exploring the frontier of the human body and mind. First small step: develop the science and tech of designing multiple viable human metabolisms for traveling to and living on Mars by 2040._
