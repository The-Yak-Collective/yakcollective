description: Neural clones as human-ness without the metabolic systems may likely be the parallel science and tech that may evolve as humans begin to go beyond Mars to the outer reaches of the solar system.

Abundant production and easy access of neural clones ([digital clones embedded in transhumans](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/no-death-and-an-enhanced-life-is-the-future-transhuman)). Up/down loading of neural data has led to democratization of knowledge across mass of humans. The first Interstellar Space Station 1 crew of 500 humans arrived at AU 122 following the Voyager 1 Track, after 50 years in hibernation (launched from Mars in 2050). Crew confirmed to have biologically [aged about 5 metabolic years during the 50 solar years travel](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/no-death-and-an-enhanced-life-is-the-future-transhuman). After exit Crew connected with their individual neural clone in Space-Cloud Farms, for a 50 solar years knowledge base update. Each neural clone has been active professionally and socially during the 50 solar earth years. Neural clones as human-ness without the metabolic systems may likely be the parallel science and tech that may evolve as humans begin to go beyond Mars to the outer reaches of the solar system.
