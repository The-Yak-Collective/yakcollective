Future Frontiers is set up as an indefinitely evolving project, to which new modules can be added at any time. Any member of the Yak Collective is welcome to contribute a module (subject to editorial approval) on any frontiers-related topic at any time. If you would like to contribute a module, check out [the project page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/O12GM-bXp) for details.

We’ve made a special effort to make this project newbie-contribution friendly. It is one of the easiest and fastest ways for you to learn what the Yak Collective is about, and how to get active within it.

When you contribute to _Future Frontiers_, you will make new friends, learn how our projects work, earn a member page on this website, and level up your role from _yak_ to _made yak_ on our Discord server. All you need is an interesting take on the nature of frontiers that can be captured in a few slides and short notes. If you can’t think of a topic,  there is a list of prompts and suggestions available for you on the project page.
