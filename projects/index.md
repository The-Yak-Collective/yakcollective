Yak Collective projects are collaborations and explorations from the community.

> [!inactive-project]- [online governance primer](online%20governance%20primer.md)
> This primer is intended as a guided tour through a curated set of readings that can help groups and organizations navigate this question. In selecting the readings we cast a wide net, but in our discussions we made an effort to consider them from the specific perspective of online governance challenges. We believe the ideas surveyed here are applicable to groups and organizations with widely varied purposes, levels of autonomy, degrees of decentralization, and technological sophistication.

> [!inactive-project]- [Future Frontiers](future%20frontiers.md)
> In the wake of Covid19, could an era of democratized access to frontiers be the key to a renewed sense of larger purpose in the universe for humanity? In this continuously evolving project, members of the Yak Collective ponder our future as an exploratory species.

> [!inactive-project]- [Astonishing Stories](astonishing%20stories1/index.md)
> The upside of an extremely uncertain environment is that we have been free to indulge in pure speculation about the known knowns and unknown unknowns of the future. The result is Astonishing Stories, an anthology of short vignettes from the future developed from the networked thoughts of over 30 indie consultants.

> [!inactive-project]- [new old home](new%20old%20home.md)
> The Yak Collective's second report, *The New Old Home*, offers 22 perspectives built around Pamela Hobart's central thesis: as work returns to the home in the form of remote work opportunities (a trend now dramatically accelerated by pandemic circumstances), we can turn to historical modes of integrated living, reconsidered in light of newer technology, to guide our attempts at co-located life and work.

> [!inactive-project]- [Donâ€™t Waste the Reboot](dont%20waste%20the%20reboot.md)
> The inaugural report by the Yak Collective, *Don't Waste the Reboot* offers organizations a smorgasbord of 25 creative and unexpected provocations, ideas, and action frameworks to navigate the COVID-19 crisis.
