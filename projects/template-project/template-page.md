# Project Sub-Page Template

This is the template file for project sub-pages. These pages live in a project resource folder (such as `projects/future-frontiers/` or `projects/astonishing-stories/`) and should _not_ have a `layout` attribute specified in their front matter. These pages are _almost_ identical to generic pages (see `template-page.md` in the project root), but have the following restrictions:

- They _cannot_ use the `widget-iframe` widget.
- They always include an index of (non-hidden) project pages as their last element.

Otherwise, these are just plain Markdown files; in Jekyll, these files should conform to the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) spec. See any of the _Astonishing Stories_ sub-pages, (such as ["Wholeness in a Timeless Activity"](/projects/astonishing-stories/wholeness-in-a-timeless-activity/)) for example of project sub-pages.

## Required Front Matter

No front matter (the bit between the two `---` lines at the top of the file, which _must_ be included, even if there's nothing between them) is required for generic pages _if_ the first line of the actual page contents is a top-level header (`# Project Sub-Page Template` in the present case). If you _don't_ want to start your page with a header line for whatever reason, _or_ if you want your page title (as displayed by the browser) to be different than this initial header line, then you should include a `title` attribute. For example,

```markdown
---
title: "Something Something"
---
# Something Else

Page content, and so on.
```

will generate a page whose top-level header is _Something Else_, but whose browser tab uses the title _Something Something_.

Be aware that if the _value_ of your front matter attribute contains a `:`, `&`, or `#`, then you _must_ either surround it in double quotes (`"`) _or_ use a `|` character, followed by a line break, and then with subsequent lines (until the next front matter attribute or the closing `---`) indented by _two_ spaces. So something like this

```yaml
title: "My #1 Page Title: Now With Two Unsafe Characters!"
```

is equivalent to

```yaml
title: |
  My #1 Page Title: Now With Two Unsafe Characters!
```

In general, you should use quotes for shorter, single line values. Use the "`|` + indent" syntax for longer values, or when you need to use multiple lines.

For more information about the ins-and-outs of page front matter, refer to [Jekyll's documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and the [YAML specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

_Optional_ front matter attributes are listed in the next section.

## Optional Front Matter

The following _optional_ front matter attributes are supported for generic pages.

```yaml
title: The Page Title
date: 2020-12-09 00:00:00
hero_image: /projects/astonishing-stories/agglomerizing-the-aesthetic.jpg
hero_attach_vertical: center
hero_attach_horizontal: center
description: A description of the page.
author: 100007
hidden: false
page_text_color: black
page_bg_color: 255,255,255
page_css: /path/to/custom.css
```

Each of these header attributes is described in more detail in the following sections.

### `title`

Use this to set a page title that's _different_ than your initial header line (`# My Page Title`). If you do not include an initial header, then this attribute is _required_. See the previous section on _Required Front Matter_.

### `date`

This is the project sub-page's publication date in ISO "YYYY-MM-DD". Because of limitations with how Jekyll handles date conversions, it's necessary to specify this as a full timestamp, though by convention the time part is always "00:00:00" (no timezone). Thus December 9, 2020 would be written as `2020-12-09 00:00:00`.

Be aware that Netlify's build environment uses UTC for its timezone, so "publish on December 9th" may not _actually_ mean that the page goes live on _your_ December 9th.

Note that pages are sorted by `widget-project-page-list` by date, and then by URL (file name). In order to make sure that your project sub-pages are displayed in a consistent manner, it is advisable to either include the `date` on all pages (even if it's not always the same) or on _no_ pages (best if the date is not relevant for your project sub-page ordering).

### `hero_image`

An image used to represent the project sub-page. It is used for the project page cards generated by `widget-project-page-list`; see [_Astonishing Stories_](/projects/astonishing-stories/) for an example. Also used as the page's Twitter card.

Should generally be a square or _portrait_ image 512px - 2048px on its longest side.

### `hero_attach_vertical`

One of `top`, `bottom`, or `center`. This is used by `widget-project-page-list` to help position the `hero_image` in the sub-page's card. Pick the value that best matches where the "focus" of the image is. If omitted, defaults to `center`.

### `hero_attach_horizontal`

One of `left`, `right`, or `center`. This is used by `widget-project-page-list` to help position the `hero_image` in the sub-page's card. Pick the value that best matches where the "focus" of the image is. If omitted, defaults to `center`.

### `description`

A short one-or-two sentence description that will be displayed on Twitter cards, Facebook shares, etc. If you don't include this attribute, then the first 20 words of the page content will be used instead. While you _can_ include Markdown or HTML formatting here, it will be stripped during the build process, so best to just use plain text.

### `author`

The page author. Ideally, this should be the filename (less the extension) of someone in the `members` directory: So, to specify Venkatesh Rao as a page author, you'd set this to `100041` (since the corresponding member file is `members/100041.md`). When use in this form, information about the specified Yak Collective member will be pulled into Twitter (and other services that support Twitter cards) when the page URL is shared.

Alternately, you can just specify someone's name ("Venkatesh Rao"). This is still useful to do to attribute the page (`author` information gets used in a lot of places), but won't pull in _any_ additional information (so the page will be attributed simple to the Yak Collective on Twitter, _et al._).

### `hidden`

Whether or not the sub-page should be hidden in the `widget-project-page-list` display. If you just want every one of your sub-pages to be displayed, then you can safely omit this attribute. But if you want `widget-project-page-list` to instead display a list of "entry points" into your sub-pages, with the remaining sub-pages linked from those entry points but not otherwise displayed, then you should set this attribute to `false` for entry point sub-pages and `true` for all other sub-pages.

### `page_text_color`

One of `black` (for black text on a default white background) or `white` (for white text on a default black background). If unset, defaults to `black`.

### `page_bg_color`

Use this to override the default page background color, as specified by `page_text_color` (above). This color _must_ be specified as an RGB tuple; for example, `255,255,0` is a bright yellow, and `128,128,128` is a medium gray.

### `page_css`

An attribute for advanced users; should contain the path to a custom CSS file that will be inserted for *only* this page.

Note that the Yak Collective website is based on the [Tachyons design framework](https://tachyons.io/docs/), so you can use any of the classes that Tachyons defines _without_ specifying a custom file in `page_css`.

Be aware that it's very easy to break you page if you don't know what you're doing with this attribute. If anything in the above two paragraphs doesn't make sense to you, you should probably _not_ use this attribute!

## Widgets

A variety of widgets can be included as part of your project sub-page.

### `widget-google-slides`

Insert a Google Slide deck in a centered "breakout box". _Requires_ a single parameter:

- **`gid`** is the Google Drive document ID for the Google Slides you want to embed. The `gid` is the long random string immediately prior to `/edit` in the URL for your document (not including the leading or trailing `/`).

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-google-slides.html
   gid="1OfBuSq4SImE1Gq2EaAGCAlkwC8LZRCWx-7O_VOHJ5TI"
%}
```

See [_Don't Waste the Reboot_](/projects/dont-waste-the-reboot/) and [_The New Old Home_](/projects/the-new-old-home/) for examples of this widget in action.

### `widget-image`

Insert an image in a "breakout box". This is provided as a fancier, more versatile alternative to just writing `![My alt text.](/path/to/image.jpg)` in Markdown; however, be aware that images included in this fashion will _not_ show up in site RSS feeds!

This widget _requires_ the following parameter:

- **`image`** is the path to the image to include (relative to the final site).

There are also two optional parameters:

- **`layout`** can be one of `left` (pop content out on the left), `right` (pop content out on the right), `center` (center content, but pop out slightly from the main text on _both_ the left and right), or `full-bleed` (span from the left side of the browser window all the way to the right). If omitted, `center` will be used.

- **`alt`** specifies the image alt text. Including a descriptive alt text is recommended for accessibility reasons. Do not use Markdown!

- **`caption`** specifies a caption, and is often used to provide image credits. Markdown is permitted here.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-image.html
   layout="left"
   image="/projects/astonishing-stories/wholeness-in-a-timeless-activity.jpg"
   alt="Wholeness in a Timeless Activity"
   caption="Illustration by [Justice](/members/100048/)."
%}
```

See _Astonishing Stories_ project (sub)pages (such as ["Wholeness in a Timeless Activity"](/projects/astonishing-stories/wholeness-in-a-timeless-activity/)) for examples of this widget in action.

### `widget-member-bio`

Member bios pull in member biographical data and provide a link to the appropriate member page. Always outputs the member name using an `<h3/>` tag. You probably want to include these at the end of the page in their own (`<h2/>`) section.

_Requires_ a single parameter:

- **`member`** is someone's Knack "Member ID". For example, Venkatesh Rao's member bio would be called by passing in `member=100041`.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-member-bio.html
   member=100041
%}
```

### `widget-project-box`

Project boxes display project summary information, similar to member cards. As with member cards, they can be presented either as links to project pages or plain information containers, but unlike member cards you can't specify which to use -- project boxes are links if the project has been published, and simple containers if the project is unpublished.

There is a single _required_ parameter:

- **`project`** specifies a project ID -- the name of the file corresponding to the project in the `/projects/` directory, less the `.md` bit. So Future Frontier's project ID is specified by setting `project="future-frontiers"`.

The is also an optional parameter:

- **`hide_published`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter; when truthy, it _hides_ the final "published" timestamp line. Treated as falsy if omitted, which is almost always what you want.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-project-box.html
   project="future-frontiers"
%}
```

Project boxes can be found on many pages throughout the Yak Collective website. For example, the [_Projects_](/projects/) displays a list of project boxes in their "default" mode, while the [_Now_](/now/) page displays project boxes in the (unpublished) "container" mode with the timestamp line hidden.

### `widget-toc`

A widget that generates a "table of contents" from document headings. It has no configuration, and can _only_ be included on Markdown-formatted pages. If you are including this widget, it must come either immediately after the opening header line (`# My Page Title`) _or_ be the _first_ thing on the page if no leading header is being used.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-toc.md %}
```

See the [_About_](/about/) page for an example of this `widget-toc` in action.

### `widget-post-list`

A widget that generates a list of _posts_, organized by month and year. It can _only_ be included on Markdown-formatted pages.

Be aware that [_posts_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) are **_not_** the same thing as [_pages_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/). Currently, only cached newsletter pages and member writings are accessible using this widget.

This widget has no required parameters _per se_, but if you're using it you'll almost certainly want to set at least some of the following:

- **`init_header_level`** specifies the initial header level to use. If "2" is passed in, then `h2` tags will be used for years and `h3` tags for months, etc. Defaults to "2", as that's what most pages will use. Values larger than "5" are treated as "5", since `<h7/>` tags don't exist in HTML.

- **`show_author`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter that specifies whether to show post author (if it is set).

- **`author`** allows you to filter posts by a given member ID (`100041`, etc.).

- **`category`** allows you to filter posts by category. Currently only `newsletters` and `writings` are valid post categories.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-post-list.md
   init_header_level=2
   show_author=true
   category="writings"
%}
```

The canonical post list is the [_Writings_](/writings/) page, but it is also included on some individual member pages.

### `widget-project-header`

The widget that's used to display a project header. It's really meant to be included as the first line of content for a project, but if you want you can include it anywhere by specifying the optional `project` parameter (which should be a valid project ID). This parameter is not necessary on the project's main page.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-project-header.html
   project="dont-waste-the-reboot"
%}
```

See [_Don't Waste the Reboot_](/projects/dont-waste-the-reboot/), [_The New Old Home_](/projects/the-new-old-home/), [_Astonishing Stories_](/projects/astonishing-stories/), and [_Future Frontiers_](/projects/future-frontiers/) for examples of this widget in action.

### `widget-project-page-list`

Include a grid of project page boxes for all _displayed_ pages associated with a given project. A "displayed" project page is one for which the `hidden` front matter attribute is either false or unset; see `projects/template-project/template-page.md` for more details.

Projects will be listed (in ascending order) by date, and then by URL (essentially file name).

This widget is designed to be included on a project's main page, and requires no parameters in this case. In all other cases, the `project` parameter should be included and set to a valid project ID.

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-project-page-list.html
   project="astonishing-stories"
%}
```

See [_Astonishing Stories_](/projects/astonishing-stories/) for an example of this widget in action.

### `widget-project-slide-deck`

Create [an _Idle Words_ style "infinity" slide deck](https://idlewords.com/talks/). This is accomplished by chaining together instances of `widget-slide`, with slide data drawn from project slide files (see `projects/template-project/project-slide.md`).

Slides will be listed (in ascending order) by URL (essentially file name).

You can technically call this without any parameters from a project's main page, but you'll probably be much happier if you set at least _some_ of the many optional parameters:

- **`project`** specifies a valid project ID ("future-frontiers"). It is only necessary if `widget-project-slide-deck` is included in a page other than a project's main page.

- **`hero_position`** specifies whether slide hero images should be on the `left` or `right` for _all_ slides. If unset, each slide will use the value specified by the slide file itself (which may or may not be consistent).

- **`slide_separator`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter that specifies whether or not to add a (top) border between slides.

- **`slide_align`** specifies whether slide `hero_image` and `slide_content` should be aligned to the `top`, `bottom`, or `center` for _all_ slides. If unset, each slide will use the value specified by the slide file itself (which may or may not be consistent).

- **`title_links`** controls how slide titles should be linked. One of `internal` (links to the anchor of the current slide), `external` (links to the stand-alone slide page), or `none` (no link). If unset, `external` is used.

- **`show_dates`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter that specifies whether or not slide dates should be displayed.

- **`collapse_slides`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter that specifies whether or not slide titles and authors should be suppressed if identical between sequential slides.

- **`table_of_contents`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter that specifies whether a table of contents for the deck should be generated.

- **`table_of_contents_hero`** secifies the image to use for the table of contents slide. If unset, the project's `hero_image` attribute is used.

- **`table_of_contents_hero_description`** specifies the image alt text for the table of contents slide. If unset, the project's `title` attribute is used.

- **`table_of_contents_hero_caption`** specifies the image caption for the table of contents slide (generally used for image credits).

Example usage:

```markdown
{% include widget-project-slide-deck.html
   project="future-frontiers"
   hero_position="left"
   slide_separator=true
   slide_align="top"
   title_links="internal"
   show_dates=true
   collapse_slides=true
   table_of_contents=true
   table_of_contents_hero="/projects/future-frontiers/table-of-contents.jpg"
   table_of_contents_hero_description="Table of contents"
   table_of_contents_hero_caption="[Venkatesh Rao](/members/100041)"
%}
```

See [_Future Frontiers_](/projects/future-frontiers/) for an example of this widget in action.

### `widget-slide`

An advanced, lower-level widget used for producing slide-like layouts. The main reason this is considered to be "advanced" is that you will generally want to pass in either multi-line Markdown or straight HTML for the `slide_content`, which necessitates the use of [Liquid's `capture` operator](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/#capture). It _requires_ only a single parameter:

- **`slide_content`** is the, well, slide content. It can be either Markdown or HTML (or a mix). Keep in mind that this is a slide, so you should probably stick to something short -- a paragraph (maybe two), a bulleted list, etc.

There are a bevy of optional parameters:

- **`hero_image`** is the "hero" image for the slide, which will take up half of the space either to the left or right of the `slide_content`. If unset, a full-width slide is produced (images can still be embedded within that slide using Markdown or HTML, however).

- **`hero_position`** specified whether `hero_image` will be on the `left` or `right` of the `slide_content`. If unset, `left` is used.

- **`hero_description`** is the alt text for the `hero_image`.

- **`hero_caption`** specifies a caption to display below the `hero_image`. Most commonly used for image credits.

- **`hero_border`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter indicating whether or not to display a thin border around the `hero_image`. If unset, no border is drawn.

- **`slide_separator`** is a [truthy/falsy](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/truthy-and-falsy/) parameter indicating whether or not to add a border along the top of the slide. This is useful to set when displaying multiple slides sequentially.

- **`slide_align`** specifies whether the `hero_image` and `slide_content` should be `top`, `bottom`, or `center` aligned. If unset, `top` will be used (which is probably what you want).

- **`slide_id`** specifies an HTML element ID to be attached to the slide's containing `<div/>`. This is useful if you want to link to a slide or use the `page_css` front matter attribute to specify per-slide CSS styling.

Most of the time you'll want to create project slides (see `projects/template-project/template-slide.md`) and then use `widget-project-slide-deck` to display them, rather than calling this widget directly. Check out [_Future Frontiers_](/projects/future-frontiers/) to get a sense of what `widget-slide` (along with a little CSS) can do.

### `widget-breakout-box`

An advanced, low-level widget that breaks a specified bit of content out of the main text flow. Can be used for pull quotes and the like (Markdown), but can also be passed entire blocks of HTML. It _requires_ a single parameter:

- **`content`** defines the content (HTML or Markdown) to be removed from the main text flow.

There are also two optional parameters:

- **`layout`** can be one of `left` (pop content out on the left), `right` (pop content out on the right), `center` (center content, but pop out slightly from the main text on _both_ the left and right), or `full-bleed` (span from the left side of the browser window all the way to the right; you probably only want to use this when passing HTML). If omitted, `center` will be used.

- **`extra_class`** specifies additional class(es) that will be added to the outer `<div/>` of the breakout box. Useful for controlling positioning for fancy formatting (either Tachyons classes or styling specified directly using the `page_css` front matter attribute).

Note that `widget-google-slides`, `widget-image`, `widget-post-list`, `widget-project-header`, `widget-project-page-list`, and `widget-slide` are all based off of `widget-breakout-box`.
