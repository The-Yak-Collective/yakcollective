Yak Collective study groups are workshop tracks for learning varied topics of interest to Yak Collective members. Some study groups have regular (generally weekly) meetings, while others run asynchronously in the associated Discord channel.

> [!inactive-project]- [Fermi Gym](fermi%20gym.md)
> The Fermi Gym at the Yak Collective is an ongoing activity in our Discord where we take turns posing weekly Fermi estimation problems for each other. The goal is to steadily improve our skills, and develop a better, and more quantitative appreciation for the universe we live in. 

> [!study-group] [Yak Robotics Garage](yak%20robotics%20garage.md)
> The Yak Robotics Garage (YaRG) is an informal robotics research group with a relatively mature focus on rovers, with an aspirational goal of deploying open-source rovers on Mars, starting with rovers in living rooms on Earth. In 2024, we are starting to explore other verticals besides rovers.
