Yak Collective work groups maintain the environment necessary for [study groups](../study%20groups/index.md) and [projects](../projects/index.md) to function. This is everything from building [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots and [this website](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective) to providing proofing, layout, and artwork.

> [!work-group] **[Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)**
> The Yak Collective Infrastructure team maintains this website, as well as a variety of Discord bots and related infrastructure. All development of our custom code is available publicly on GitHub. If you know a bit of coding (or want to learn!) or prefer to contribute in a more behind-the-scenes fashion, consider joining us!
