The Yak Collective Infrastructure team maintains [this website](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/yakcollective), as well as a variety of [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots and [related infrastructure](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/ArtOfGig/page/6fhTlx1p_). All development of our custom code is available publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Yak-Collective/). If you know a bit of coding (or want to learn!) or prefer to contribute in a more behind-the-scenes fashion, consider [joining us](../join.md) and then dropping by the [âŒ—infrastructure channel](https://discord.com/channels/692111190851059762/704369362315772044) to say hello!
