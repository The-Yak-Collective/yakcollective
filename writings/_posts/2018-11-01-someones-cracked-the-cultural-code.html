<p>For a very long time, American internet start-ups have failed in China, and Chinese internet start-ups have failed to get traction in America, or in fast growing internet markets like India. </p><h3>Not getting their story right</h3><p>Most of the efforts on both sides have missed cultural nuances that affect the core user experience of the products. For example, AirBnB is the latest entrant in a long chain of American start-up migrants trying to make an impression in the Chinese market. While their attempt has been fairly solid with a reported revenue of $130 million in 2018, they have had their fair share of problems with their Chinese adopted name <a href="https://qz.com/939253/chinas-consumers-hate-airbnbs-new-chinese-name-so-much-that-they-are-brainstorming-a-new-one/">Aibiying being ridiculed by Chinese consumers </a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-china-market/">recent botched attempt to make a BnB out of a watch tower on the Great Wall of China</a>. </p><p>On the Chineses side, the much vaunted social media app WeChat failed to make an impression in India despite launching before WhatsApp. The reason being an inability to <a href="https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/">figure out how cultural nuances affect the core user experience</a>.</p><h4>Branding is hard and probably not a problem that can be solved by data fetish. </h4><h3>Along came&#8230;.</h3><p><strong>Bytedance.</strong><br>The worlds most valued start-up and owner of social app TikTok has cracked this code by not pretending to merge the brands and creating a clear distinction between Chineses internet and American internet. Their recent acquisition TikTok targets the western market while their original app Douyin is available only in China.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html">To quote the recent NYT report on the app</a></p><blockquote><p>So far, Bytedance &#8212; which recently secured $3 billion in new funding from SoftBank and other heavyweight investors &#8212; has found a rare measure of success in both internets by doing things a little differently.</p><p>For one, it is making no pretense to be bridging the two digital realms.</p><p>Users of Douyin are entirely walled off from users of TikTok and vice versa; </p></blockquote><p>It is also interesting to note that most of the users of TikTok do not know that the app is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. TikTok has been on a heavy advertising spree, spending massively on Snapchat, YouTube and even having a billboard up in Brooklyn. So it&#8217;s not surprising that most of Gen Z (the primary users of the app) do not know of its Chinese leadership. </p><p>It&#8217;s not that this has not been done before. FMCG and luxury  brands seem to do this all the time. The Coco-Cola company acquired Topo Chico in 2017 and in its third quarter earnings for 2018, attributed its growth in North American and South American markets to not changing the &#8216;Topo Chico heritage&#8217;. </p><p>But its new for the internet. One of the core reasons for the growth of tech start-ups (in funding and on IPOs) has been the ability to scale across the world with minimal marginal cost. Uber is a prime example of a start-up that scaled fast across the world because it did not need to reinvent the proverbial (and in this case metaphorical) wheel in all the new markets it entered. </p><h4>But with the internet slowly splitting into two. Start-ups would have to account for marginal costs, especially in marketing, if it wants to tap into the 2 billion people living in China </h4><p>To continue where I left off in the<a href="https://prospecttheory.substack.com/p/coming-soon"> first newsletter</a>, Is TikTok the new new thing of social media, will it last long enough for advertisers to take advantage of or will it slowly <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/29/is-it-time-to-give-up-on-snap-inc-stock.aspx">disappear into oblivion like Snap Inc&#8217;s stock</a> ?</p><h4>Some interesting reads around ByteDance</h4><p><a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1349585/you-are-not-original-or-creative-on-instagram/">Everything is a copy of a copy on Instagram.
