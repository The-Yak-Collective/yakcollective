Poet and academic Adele Ward takes a critical eye to the form, themes, and emotional undercurrents of Cyclone in her latest review for London Grip. She praises both its craft and handling of emotionally difficult subject matter, and even picks up on obscure references I feared would be all but lost on most readers (such as the Tasmanian devil cartoon and Judy Garlandâ€™s opioid exploitation).
