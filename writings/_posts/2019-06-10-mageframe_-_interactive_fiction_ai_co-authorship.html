<p>I just received my unique copy of <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/">Robin Sloan’s</a> latest weird experiment, <a href="https://desert.glass/mageframe/">MageFrame</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;‘And Every Time the Dark Lord Wins...’ and it’s super interesting.</p>
<p>The fictional premise is that wizards are trying to fight back against the&nbsp;‘Dark Lord’ and are running simulations to find a successful approach, but in each simulation the heroes are defeated.</p>
<p>The way MageFrame works is that each reader (e.g. me) fills out a Google Form with narrative prompts (e.g. What do the questers seek?) which them is fed into a AI (GPT-2) algorithm that fleshes out a meta-scenario designed by Robin. The unique result is then mailed out to the reader, including a map!</p>
<p>You can see my results below – the AI did a surprisingly decent job of creating a legible story, though how much is due to Robin’s meta-structure I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p>I think this is a really cool approach to interactive storytelling I’m keen to see more experiments like it in the future. A few natural extensions could be:</p>
<p>– Serialized stories where the reader provides new prompts after each&nbsp;“chapter”</p>
<p>– Prompting more storytelling on the part of the reader through both open ended and pointed questions. Single-player rpgs and larps have been exploring this space for a bit and I think there could be a cool hybrid approach with a GPT-2 algorithm</p>
