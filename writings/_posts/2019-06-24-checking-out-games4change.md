This week I swung by NYC for the Games4Change festival. It was my first time attending and it was great to see lots of designers working on serious games for social good.

The most helpful session I attended gave an overview of different government grants that are being given out for game design, mostly by NSF, NIH, and the Department of Education. It looks like they have extremely long application cycles but the grants are quite sizable $200,000 and up. Iâ€™ll be looking into them a bit more and possibly applying later this year.

Most of the conversation was round digital games but I did find some great analog designers to talk to. Hopefully next year there will be even more folks working on in-person games!
