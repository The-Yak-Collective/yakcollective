<p>I recently bought the new <a href="https://amzn.to/2J1aZXK">Oculus Quest</a>&nbsp;VR headset and it’s incredibly impressive. I’m convinced that this will be the year that consumer VR goes mainstream and I suspect the Quest will be the smash hit this holiday season. The surge of new adopters will lead to more startups and investment in VR content kicking off a positive feedback loop drawing in new customers and content creators.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with VR for years and while I’ve always believed in its potential there were very real drawbacks preventing wide spread adoption:</p>
<ul><li>Expensive: maybe $2,000 including the headset and a powerful computer</li><li>Poor quality, due to low resolution screens, unreliable sensors, and / or a long cord that was a tripping hazard</li><li>Onerous set-up: room-scale VR required positioning sensors around the room and dragging the controllers around the floor</li></ul>
<p>The Quest overcomes most of these:</p>
<ul><li>$399 starting price, same as a video game console</li><li>Decent resolution screen and great controllers</li><li>Room-scale without external sensors (there are cameras on the headset)</li></ul>
<p>The experience is magical, you just put on the headset, without any cords and immediately in a rich virtual environment. The quality of the room-scale experience is phenomenally immersive and I’ve enjoyed friends and family jump in and be blown away.</p>
<p>While previous generations of VR felt like a cool gimmick, I anticipate using the Quest almost every day for a combination of exercise (finally fun!), entertainment experiences, and social spaces. Hopefully I’ll have an opportunity to design to VR experiences as well.</p>
<p>Despite loving the Quest so far, there are a few downsides:</p>
<ul><li>The current content library is a little small and a bit overpriced, though I expect that to change rapidly</li><li>A lot of the UX in both the OS and apps is clunky, but I’m sure these will improve quickly</li><li>The headset is a bit heavy and uncomfortable after an hour of use</li></ul>
<p>These are fairly minor quibbles, though, especially compared to past generations.</p>
<p>If you’ve been considering getting into VR, now’s a great time to jump in!</p>
