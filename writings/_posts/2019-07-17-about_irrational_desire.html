<p>the rustle of leaves is therapeutical,</p>

<p>the early sunlight falling on snow,</p>

<p>the woman talking and talking into my face,</p>

<p>the silence of her words is comforting,</p>

<p>as they fade into the air.</p>

<p>donâ€™t ask why,</p>

<p>for it leads us astray.</p>

<p>the pheromone of the feminine</p>

<p>what does it awake within,</p>

<p>that no other object can.</p>

<p>the masterpiece of nature,</p>

<p>with the undeniable pull of the beauty,</p>

<p>she floats around unaware,</p>

<p>as the clock ticks by</p>

<p>on another routine day.</p>

<p>as the light of passion shines,</p>

<p>often the clay of rationality crumbles,</p>

<p>under the weight of its own assumptions.</p>

<p>when the truth gets naked,</p>

<p>the time gets warped,</p>

<p>the irrational desire overwhelms,</p>

<p>the obstacle becomes the new goal,</p>

<p>and makes me fumble along the way.</p>
