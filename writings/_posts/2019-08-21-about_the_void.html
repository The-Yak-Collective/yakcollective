<p>going about in routine</p>

<p>the charade ends</p>

<p>“what’s next?”</p>

<p>Henry is waiting.</p>

<p>look around</p>

<p>there is dark</p>

<p>search for the light</p>

<p>like he always does</p>

<p>the light is not here yet</p>

<p>“what’s the point?”</p>

<p>of holding on to this rope</p>

<p>the rope has an end</p>

<p>all ropes do</p>

<p>the ropes of rationality</p>

<p>they end into the dark</p>

<p>the dark is the void</p>

<p>it touches him</p>

<p>it is cold</p>

<p>it is silent</p>

<p>it chills his spine</p>

<p>give him the light</p>

<p>he craves for it</p>

<p>he needs the warmth</p>

<p>the warmth of pretension</p>

<p>of living flesh</p>

<p>of exhausting himself</p>

<p>of finding a subject of dedication</p>

<p>of believing in shared myths</p>

<p>it’s cold outside</p>

<p>don’t touch the void</p>

<p>it will rattle you</p>

<p>like it did poor Henry</p>

<p>don’t touch the void</p>

<p>don’t touch it.</p>
