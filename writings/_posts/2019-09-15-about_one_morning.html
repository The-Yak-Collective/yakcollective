<p>Trees are green and full of energy,</p>

<p>shedding the old leaves</p>

<p>Water flows in unending rythym</p>

<p>The mountains stand in front of me in confidence</p>

<p>I woke up before the sun to-day</p>

<p>I now see it making golden outlines on that cloud</p>

<p>as it touches the highest tip of the mountains.</p>

<p>The therapeutic sound of water stream by my side.</p>

<p>Oh the chirps of these little birds are filling the air</p>

<p>While the insects of the night screech no more</p>

<p>People are waking up getting into the chores of the day</p>

<p>Just like the vines in my garden,</p>

<p>growing another inch with every day.</p>

<p>The owl is looking for a place without disturbance</p>

<p>That is what I seek.</p>

<p>I find it among the nature, in my garden in the hills.</p>

<p>The fresh air I breathe and the ground I sit upon,</p>

<p>all is well when I am aligned with nature.</p>
