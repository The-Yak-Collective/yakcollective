## Transcript

**Ben** [00:00:00] Hello everybody and welcome to episode 2 of the Hired Thought podcast. I am very happy to be joined today by Anthony Mastrean. He and I go way back. We worked together at an old organization. He taught me a lot of things, and I like to think that we have a lot of interesting stories to tell. Anthony tell us a little bit about yourself. Where are you right now in this wonderful world.?

**Anthony** [00:00:23] Hey Ben, I‚Äôm actually working from home these days which is‚Ä¶ man, it‚Äôs really screwing me up for future employment. I don‚Äôt know if I can go back to somebody else‚Äôs office in any capacity.

**Ben** [00:00:39] Do you have a kid in each arm while you‚Äôre working every morning, is that how it works?

**Anthony** [00:00:41] Yeah well that‚Äôs a big part of it. I‚Äôve got two little ones, so occasionally they‚Äôre my pair programmers or office partners, if you want to call them that.

**Ben** [00:00:51] Family mob programming I guess.

**Anthony** [00:00:53] Right. Yeah. So maybe in a couple of years when they‚Äôre in public school for most the day, that might change things, but‚Ä¶

**Ben** [00:00:58] So you‚Äôre working from home. We met when we were working at McKesson. We were working on pharmacy systems and doing kind of like lots of interesting stuff there. I guess let‚Äôs talk through the origin story just a little bit. I think I first met you at devopsdays Pittsburgh 2014.

**Anthony** [00:01:22] Yeah there was a‚Ä¶ I think of that as the year of serendipity. There was a lot of meetings and and happenings and like intellectual things occurring for myself, I don‚Äôt know, maybe for Pittsburgh? It‚Äôs hard to claim anything for an entire region. But there was definitely some stuff starting that year.

**Ben** [00:01:40] Yeah, let‚Äôs claim it for Pittsburgh. Let‚Äôs claim it for you, too. So tell me a little bit about that though. What was going on that year for you?

**Anthony** [00:01:49] [00:01:49]I think the way I like to describe it to I don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know whether to be cheeky or introspective. I think I became like a reluctant devop or something like that. [11.8s]

**Ben** [00:02:02] [00:02:02]The lone reluctant devop. [1.0s]

**Anthony** [00:02:05] [00:02:05]Was it reluctant, or is it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Anyway, I had had enough of just normal application development, which is funny, ‚Äôcause that‚Äôs where‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the meat of this industry. So many developers developing right. Yet there‚Äôs so much more work to be done. And I think I either accidentally or kind of subconsciously found myself constantly drawn to that other stuff. The things that happened, not just before you start jamming on the keyboard, you know what‚Äôs up with work planning, you know? Or organization of teams? Or is this a JIRA ticket? Like what kind of system are we using? Right but like even after all that, right OK, we‚Äôve got this code? Where‚Äôs it going? Is there a build?. Are there tests? Should you test first? Is the build passing? Has it been red for four months, like you know all these things. What about deployment. Who‚Äôs deploying this? And where and how are those environments managed? You know even down a little bit, like where am I committing this code to? Who‚Äôs server is running source control? It‚Äôs actually a desktop under someone‚Äôs desk‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs all of these questions I think that surround development that‚Ä¶  I think a lot of people make a lot of it, like ‚Äúwell,  you know, developers ought to understand all that.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs like the Twitter version of the job, right. Sure. All you, you know, blue checkmark people on Twitter saying that developers should know all this. That‚Äôs different than the thousands of people we‚Äôve all worked with who don‚Äôt work like that. So there‚Äôs this massive gap. [105.1s]

**Ben** [00:03:52] [00:03:52]You can point at all sorts of stuff, like how do people learn? How is it that you are supposed to have come by those skills, by that knowledge? And the reality is, I think in a lot of especially enterprise organizations, and perhaps enterprise organizations in Pittsburgh, in particular‚Ä¶ Maybe I‚Äôm being a little bit too broad sweeping here, but I think there is a tendency to create bubbles and stay within them. And if you are doing any migrating it‚Äôs maybe between bubbles every couple of years, and they‚Äôre all such small bubbles that they‚Äôre missing the larger picture of the larger changes in practice. What do you think is at the center of that? Is it just we‚Äôre not learning when we should be learning? Or if we should know that stuff and all the blue checkmark people are telling us that, like OK, but how? And why? And when? [56.5s]

**Anthony** [00:04:48] [00:04:48]I guess it‚Äôs interesting maybe to use Pittsburgh as a foil. I don‚Äôt think we have any Thiel organizations right here in Pittsburgh, if you want to think of the wackiest organizations that are out there somewhere. So what we‚Äôve got going on is very traditional right. Like, well, we need project management, so we‚Äôve got a project management office. Well those developers just need to be developing, wo we‚Äôve got the test group, and they‚Äôre probably offshore still. It‚Äôs 2019, and we still have offshore test groups. Or, well, the developers need to develop, so we need to have‚Ä¶ well who‚Äôs going to put all that software together? Well let‚Äôs have a configuration management group, right, and let‚Äôs have a build release team. Certainly we have operators, right, and they‚Äôve got their own V.P. of operations, like there is no direct line between developers and operations so‚Ä¶ I hesitate to say these things just exist because they exist right. I don‚Äôt want to give a tautalogical answer but, man, these things just seem to exist. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think we have enough‚Ä¶ we need to bring the anthropologists in, and say, ‚ÄúWhy, why did we do this? Tell us, because we can‚Äôt see it. We‚Äôre too close to it to to understand why they exist let alone how to change it, in some cases. These are the systems of rewards and incentives and, I mean how about just job descriptions?[78.3s]

**Ben** [00:06:08] [00:06:08]Oh don‚Äôt even get me started [0.0s]

**Anthony** [00:06:09] [00:06:09]I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve encountered plenty of these team members, right. You know, the developer, the CM guy, the whatever, who‚Ä¶ maybe they even want to grow beyond what they‚Äôre doing now, but, boy, it‚Äôs not in the performance review system. So, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to cross that line.‚Äù It‚Äôs too scary in a way. There‚Äôs too much risk in doing that. [20.1s]

**Ben** [00:06:30] You have to take on a lot of risk as an individual to attempt to be‚Ä¶ essentially an anomaly, right? If the rest of the organization is aiming for uniformity‚Ä¶ [00:06:42]It‚Äôs interesting that you mention job descriptions, because my whole thing with that is‚Ä¶ tell me how you are going to describe exactly the kind of person that you want to bring in, as if it‚Äôs a part that you can go down to a shop and‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need part CL-732, and I need it in this configuration and as part of this warranty package.‚Äù All that kind of stuff as if it‚Äôs a fungible thing you just plug in. [22.8s]

**Anthony** [00:07:05] [00:07:05]Yeah. Like, how dare you describe a complex job with very simple statements in a job description. Right? [7.5s]

**Ben** [00:07:15] [00:07:15]When I was looking for work, and really before we started working together, and even after and later stages in my career, I was just looking at job descriptions. And the problem for me was constantly trying to project a version of myself that might fit into some of these boxes, and I just found that to be an impossible kind of idea. Because one, they‚Äôre not describing it, remotely. Like phenomenologically they are not describing the thing. They are describing an idealized version of the thing, which is not even‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt exist. [34.6s]

**Anthony** [00:07:51] [00:07:51]I‚Äôm always going to get this wrong, but there‚Äôs a fellow out there, Steven Shorrock. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs his idea or not, but he often comes back to this concept that there are overlapping and non overlapping things, like work as design, work as described, work as understood. And these things very rarely and in very small parts ever overlap. So you have the job description, it‚Äôs like wow, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ And who the hell wrote this thing too, right? That probably has a big effect as well. Is it what we want the job to be? Is it what the job is? Is it what I think the job is? Like there‚Äôs so many‚Ä¶ Or is it what I think will get candidates in for the job? Like it‚Äôs just such nonsense. [43.4s]

**Ben** [00:08:35] It‚Äôs so multi-dimensional, and I think this shows up everywhere, right? I guess the kind of joke here is at one point I was helping write job descriptions. When I worked with the state of PA, we needed to hire sysadmins, and I won‚Äôt say that that was my responsibility, but I was certainly contributing to that.

**Anthony** [00:08:54] Like, ‚ÄúI can do this better,‚Äù right? ‚ÄúI can help make this improvement.‚Äù And maybe you do, within an axis. Like, within whatever version of the job description that you thought the job description should be. Maybe you did make it better but‚Ä¶

**Ben** [00:09:07] That‚Äôs our pathology I think, is we show up and go, ‚ÄúOK. The system seems to be‚Ä¶ like, it‚Äôs working, clearly, but it‚Äôs also causing a lot of pain.‚Äù Like there are a lot of bones being ground up in the middle of it.

**Anthony** [00:09:18] Yeah, so I think it was‚Ä¶ lots of accidents, right? Like I started my career at FedEx. And talk about all the syndromes that any organization could have, it was there. There‚Äôs pigeonholed development, offshore testing, a CM team. A team that was responsible for ‚Äúthe builds,‚Äù the golden images and such. And towards the end of my run there, it was so‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even know whether to call it dysfunctional or not because actually we made it functional by‚Ä¶ At some point someone sent the CM team a script to build the software, because the CM team didn‚Äôt even write the scripts, right. They just ran the scripts to build the software. And at some point the script we gave them just printed, ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù And then a senior architect went off and actually did the build and release separately. So again, dysfunctional or functional? I don‚Äôt even know how to describe‚Ä¶ So there was some formative stuff going on there, at least. Here‚Äôs how some big organizations can operate. I won‚Äôt say that was all of them, but it sure did‚Ä¶ it looked like a thing.

**Ben** [00:10:28] Well I mean we like our process. We like having little boxes to check off as we go along. But I think the thing that I learned while working with you a bit, and really the lesson that‚Äôs been reinforced over and over again as I‚Äôve been finding my way into larger organizations working in a consulting and support capacity‚Ä¶ I just see how much all this stuff is just made up. We are constructing reality around us to the extent that someone else has to construct an interface to that reality. Like the script example you just gave, ‚ÄúOh this person will be nervous if they don‚Äôt have this part of their process to check off.‚Äù

**Anthony** [00:11:14] Or they might not have a job, which I mean, understandable, but like, is that a good reason? I think at McKesson it was interesting. [00:11:24]So I came in, the team was called Software Configuration Management. Like what is that? That terminology is really old, except maybe‚Ä¶ it might only be old to the coasts, right? Like a lot of businesses in the middle of the country still have a thing called SCM. And I actually think it‚Äôs still a discipline. I think there are topic areas and there are knowledge areas there, and there are patterns and practices, and I hesitate to maybe even say best practices for Software Configuration Management. And oh man, I‚Äôm about to be like so, what is the word, well, I‚Äôm going to be cheesy. Like, this job shouldn‚Äôt exist, right? So I joined this weird place. Not a developer. Which actually I‚Äôm happy, because the software system we were working on, this 15-year-old Java Swing application, boy‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt want to jump into that. But I could jump in on the edge of that, in the SCM team. So here, run the Subversion server. Babysit the builds. Handle the build and release process. So now I was that guy that I was previously handing empty scripts to. But could we effect change? Could we come in, and again, cheesy as it may sound, this job doesn‚Äôt need to exist. Developers are already doing this work right, or they‚Äôre so close to it. You know, and to hint at the Wardley side of things, why can‚Äôt we commoditize these things. Like, you‚Äôre branching strategy ought not to be creative. Your build system should not be bespoke, in most cases for line of business apps. Like literally, why does this job exist? Let‚Äôs buy a couple of cloud services, whether that‚Äôs some Bitbucket stuff, some GitLab stuff, some JIRA stuff. Just buy something. Buy something, follow a ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù Follow a decent practice that‚Äôs probably way better than what you‚Äôre doing now, maybe not the best, but the job doesn‚Äôt need to exist. But you know what job that does need to exist? The Agitator that gets everybody to change to the commodity thing. [121.7s]

**Ben** [00:13:26] Yeah I think that‚Äôs the key part of this. It‚Äôs the transition between‚Ä¶ I think all these systems that we build tend to try to maintain what already is working and what already exists‚Ä¶ The Known. And it‚Äôs working, so we should just keep doing it, right?

**Anthony** [00:13:41] Right, it‚Äôs working but it‚Äôs leaving‚Ä¶ Look at the damage it‚Äôs leaving in its wake. And I don‚Äôt think, me 10 years ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have been talking like this. I think maybe I was on the same path technically, but I was less focused on the people side. I didn‚Äôt see it, maybe because 10 years ago I had boundless energy and whatnot. But like nowadays it‚Äôs like, man, we‚Äôre just killing people. These jobs are killing people! You know we could do so much better and unleash their capacity. And emotional capacity, too. Not just like, ‚ÄúBoy, we can get more stories done.‚Äù ‚ÄúBoy, we can make people feel more valuable.‚Äù And if that valuability adds value to the company let‚Äôs go for it. I think those two things are intertwined.

**Ben** [00:14:27] The change that has occurred over‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs kind of a leapfrog moment, right, where you have the option to‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre not going to stay incrementally in step with the change that is going on around you, the evolution if you will, of things that are practices, patterns, the technology, all that kind of stuff. If you‚Äôre not going to stay in step with that, or even anticipate it, if you‚Äôre not gonna do that, you‚Äôre gonna fall behind. So I don‚Äôt know exactly how to describe this kind of transition should happen in general, but I think it‚Äôs useful to have a momentary transitionary role, where you go from‚Ä¶ I mean what was the state of SCM before, before there was a centralized‚Ä¶

**Anthony** [00:15:16] Tickets were open for three years. Builds were red for four weeks at a time.

**Ben** [00:15:21] Yeah.

**Anthony** [00:15:22] It‚Äôs funny a lot of it‚Äôs technical stuff, right. As a new person into this organization, which I think is desperately what this organization needed. The new guy at this organization had been there for nine years. And I apol- I know I‚Äôm saying guy a lot. But like literally, that‚Äôs just who they were. But nine years, there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre going to come in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre already taken away, you‚Äôre floating with the system at that point. So to be dropped in and to see that, to be able to see, ‚ÄúOh that build has literally been red for 4 weeks. This ticket in my backlog now has been open for three years. Close it or fix it or something!‚Äù But that‚Äôs easy for me to say, because I‚Äôm not here with all the organizational, emotional baggage of it how it needs to close that. I think maybe that‚Äôs important too. [00:16:15]This journey it‚Äôs not just technical. These people were shipping successful software, you know maybe not as fast as they could, which we found out later. We were able to ship much faster. So they were useful, technical, savvy individuals. So I think the problem was probably not like, ‚ÄúOh we just needed someone to come in and figure Puppet out. Do this migration from SVN to GitLab or whatever.‚Äù A lot of people could do that. But a lot of the work was, ‚ÄúHow do we bring these people along with us?‚Äù They‚Äôre scared. Like literally people were scared. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can do it this way. I‚Äôm nervous about that, either because we‚Äôre gonna lose work, or we‚Äôre going to break something, or it‚Äôs just going to hurt. What if we mess up? And then I‚Äôve got to go backwards, or I have to learn something new. I‚Äôm so comfortable with the way we‚Äôre doing it now.‚Äù [53.2s]

**Ben** [00:17:10] The performance improvement situation as well. You are evaluated based on commitments that you made three quarters ago.

**Anthony** [00:17:17] A year ago.

**Ben** [00:17:19] What is‚Ä¶ How!? You actually cannot change, unless you adopt a mentality and have the support structure that is able to look at that and go, ‚ÄúYeah, well duh. This should have changed.‚Äù I think in some ways we had some luck there where some people were a little bit more willing to go along with the malleability of that.

**Anthony** [00:17:40] I believe our team was vacant for something like six to nine months. The previous folks had‚Ä¶ I think it was a year that the last proper SCM person had quit. Someone had stepped in part time to manage things. So obviously that wasn‚Äôt going to be a huge change. And then it was literally vacant. So there was no CM. And again, well so CM shouldn‚Äôt exist, but in this context it desperately needed to exist. So yeah, we came in, and I think we came into a total‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to recreate this or even if I should‚Ä¶ But we had a new manager, a new director, a new VP, the president changed. This whole business unit down to our stupid little seats in the cube farm changed in weeks. So our performance review was not the same one that was happening to these folks who‚Äôd been there for 15 years. There‚Äôs lots and lots of things right.

**Ben** [00:18:39] Yeah I mean that was wild, because on the one hand we could literally shape the way that we could do the work, the way that we thought that it should be done.

**Anthony** [00:18:52] Yeah it was easy to come in and say, ‚ÄúThis is not how CM works‚Äù even though I didn‚Äôt know that. Like I wasn‚Äôt sure. It was my first CM job. Like what even is CM right? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been trying to say. Really accidentally joined the team this way in a position I‚Äôve never formerly held. Is CM even taught? There‚Äôs like one book that I know of.

**Ben** [00:19:12] I remember you like going into all these places on the Internet, just trying to dig and dig and dig‚Ä¶ like, ‚ÄúWhat is branching even?‚Äù  Not just asking what branching strategy should we use, like what‚Äôs popular. It was more like, ‚ÄúWhat is this even?‚Äù

**Anthony** [00:19:27] Like what even yeah‚Ä¶ This is the craziest thing about software development. And I guess a lot of people say, ‚ÄúOh but it‚Äôs a young discipline.‚Äù But we don‚Äôt actually know for sure, evidence-wise. We don‚Äôt know that source control is good. Like prove‚Ä¶ I know that it‚Äôs good, I feel good when I‚Äôm using it, but we don‚Äôt have anything like‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no study, there‚Äôs no pedagogy, there‚Äôs not like‚Ä¶ all of these hundred dollar words. Like we don‚Äôt know why what we do should be done‚Ä¶ what to do, why we should do it, how we should do it, we really don‚Äôt. We have a lot of stories right now. Maybe that‚Äôs how every industry like this starts. We don‚Äôt have 5000 years of history programming computers, but maybe someday we will.

**Ben** [00:20:16] I get really excited when I see some case studies about something.

**Anthony** [00:20:21] Yeah oh, we only have stories, but at least let‚Äôs bring 10 of them together in one paper. Can I make sense of any of this?

**Ben** [00:20:28] Somebody trying to do some analysis to figure out what makes sense here, what makes there. It‚Äôs largely expert based. You have people who we look to as the gods of the industry, if you will.

**Anthony** [00:20:41] Yeah. That‚Äôs problematic.

**Ben** [00:20:45] That‚Äôs the way, it‚Äôs the blue checkmark people. Here they are. Here‚Äôs the answer. And they‚Äôre largely giving experiential anecdotal evidence, and I‚Äôm just thinking of‚Ä¶

**Anthony** [00:20:56] And from a very unique perspective.

**Ben** [00:20:58] Yeah totally!

**Anthony** [00:20:58] Right, that‚Äôs the thing. Like the blue checkmark consultant, agile consultant, or whatever, devops‚Ä¶ Like these people are already in a totally different context than the 30 of us that have been sitting on this team for the last three years just trying to do whatever it is we‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs no‚Ä¶ I like what the folks are doing with the State of DevOps report. And of course we‚Äôre going to go there, right. Like how you‚Äôve got PhDs and scientists and statisticians. You know you‚Äôve got serious people doing serious work on this industry that is sorely lacking anything that‚Äôs serious. But I struggle with that, like a lot of this stuff comes out which is just like ‚ÄúJust do Trunk Based Development.‚Äù OK.

**Ben** [00:21:45] ‚ÄúJust.‚Äù

**Anthony** [00:21:45] And then what. Or how do I even‚Ä¶ Like, what do you mean, ‚Äújust do Trunk Based Development?‚Äù We literally, I think we had‚Ä¶ something on the order of 60 branches when we got there. And it was like, major, minor, patch, and hotfix. And I think we ran the numbers once, and we had like an average of 17 hot fixes. We contractually promised a major, two minors, and like three patch versions. If you did the math on that, we were supporting forty five versions of the software at once. We were doing it through, or you know the team, you know the ‚Äúwe‚Äù that was there at the time, we were doing it through whatever branching strategy we could figure out. You can‚Äôt just like‚Ä¶ these people on Twitter and there 120 characters at the time. ‚ÄúJust do Trunk Based Development. Good luck.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks a lot. You‚Äôre an asshole.‚Äù Like you can‚Äôt do anything with that. You know?

**Ben** [00:22:50] I think that‚Äôs it.

**Anthony** [00:22:51] It‚Äôs so frustrating.

**Ben** [00:22:52] It‚Äôs always advice, right. I get that in order to move things forward, you have to work at the edge, in the sense that you have to point at something that is‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre starting from nothing, you could probably consider starting here. That seems reasonable.

**Anthony** [00:23:08] Right. Definitely. If you were starting with nothing, right. That‚Äôs great. And I think there‚Äôs even like, there‚Äôs stuff out there, man. I‚Äôm just constantly impressed by GitLab. Like just go get GitLab. Like, just buy it. The entire thing they‚Äôve got this whole‚Ä¶ I know this is not an advertisement for GitLab but the concept like‚Ä¶

**Ben** [00:23:27] If they want to sponsor‚Ä¶

**Anthony** [00:23:27] There‚Äôs a team who‚Äôs producing tooling for you, and they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúWe want to take care of the entire process, the entire lifecycle of software from planning to designing to developing to capturing issues to doing ops. We‚Äôre gonna give you a tool kit. Now, it has opinions. It works in a certain situation. Some of those tools are different maturity levels.‚Äù But the fact that they even published a maturity chart for each of their features \*mind explosion noise\* is really great.

**Ben** [00:23:54] I think that‚Äôs really important to have that kind of structure in place, because the defaults that you get are‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre not perfect, that‚Äôs fine. But they‚Äôre at least sensible and principled probably.

**Anthony** [00:24:05] And they‚Äôre at least not 15 years of custom scripts tying together custom processes. At least you‚Äôre moving from something structured. Hopefully to something else structured but that is a better choice for whatever your context is. And that‚Äôs again why it‚Äôs so frustrating to get this advice. Or another one that I love is like, ‚ÄúJust do feature flags.‚Äù So how do I move to Trunk Based Development when I‚Äôve got release-per-branch, I‚Äôve got 45 releases that I‚Äôm contractually obligated to maintain, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a CM guy. I can‚Äôt make this corporation decide to contract their software differently. Right. We eventually did, but only because we had that whole management chain entwined in this. ‚ÄúHey how can we actually produce software faster.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell stop promising that we‚Äôre going to support forty five versions.‚Äù That idea came from us, but it was enacted by them, they talked to legal and sales and everything. So that is doable, but on a much longer timescale. So okay how do I get to Trunk Based Development now that that‚Äôs my, okay great, that‚Äôs my holy grail. How do I get there? ‚ÄúWell just do feature flags.‚Äù Well that‚Äôs not like‚Ä¶. Have you ever done feature flags? It doesn‚Äôt mean one thing. It‚Äôs complicated at best. You just gotta turn stuff on and off? Well feature flags means you‚Äôve got to really have your configuration sorted out, and that configuration now has to be exposed. Is that feature flags to the user, to an admin, to an operator? Who gets the feature flag? Where do they toggle it? How are you toggling? You really gotta have your dependency injection sorted out. What the hell is dependency injection? You have to unwind all of the job. You know, but just use feature flags dot com. So frustrating, this entire job.

**Ben** [00:25:50] There‚Äôs there‚Äôs so much work to be done to help people adopt practices from a standpoint of‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre starting with what already exists. And actually finding a path from that, do something sensible that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not even just sensible, because it all makes sense, right. Even the legacy, if you will, makes sense.

**Anthony** [00:26:11] Right, like, it can‚Äôt be irrational if it got done by human beings and it was sold. You know what I mean, and I think a lot of people like to throw that around like, ‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre not rational hahaha. Like randomness, you know.‚Äù No no. I think what rational means is that you‚Äôre reasoning. We are always reasoning, whether or not we‚Äôre coming up with the right answer or the best answer or whatever. But I think everybody was reasoning all along, right. These 15 years, that transition from startup, to corporation, I think the team was bought and sold three or four times. [00:26:49]Everybody‚Äôs reasoning. Throughout all the different performance management programs, all the different changes in methodology, they‚Äôre reasoning all along the way. So I think we gotta be careful with that, that we‚Äôre not just harming people while we‚Äôre trying to unharm people. Like, ‚ÄúYou idiots did that.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWe did this thing, obviously. But maybe we can do a little bit of a different thing.‚Äù [26.1s]

**Ben** [00:27:18] This is probably a weird place to go with this but the thing that I heard Jabe (@cyetain) say recently‚Ä¶ We had a really interesting conversation with Sue Borchardt (@contemplatethis) about‚Ä¶ It was focused on on some things that Jabe was tweeting about, but one of the things he mentioned was like Janus time. The god of transition, the two faces. When you‚Äôre changing, you are literally in both the future state and the previous past state at the same time, and you‚Äôre trying to reconcile both of those things together. Just hearing that was like, ‚ÄúOhhhh, right. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard.‚Äù Because we have to be of two minds at once. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I have a hard time being of one mind at any one given point in time, let alone‚Ä¶

**Anthony** [00:28:08] Right. Right. And in part, you‚Äôre also, like we talked about earlier, you‚Äôre in the mind of the thing that you‚Äôre trying to change, too. The thing was brought together by how many people‚Ä¶ We call it the organization, because it‚Äôs hard to‚Ä¶ Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to literally know. I don‚Äôt know who to blame for this, to go ask them, ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking and why? And what were all the forces on you?‚Äù No, at some point we just have a shortcut. The organization made this, maybe you understand what was going on in the organization at the time. So now you‚Äôre of two minds, you‚Äôre reflecting on the other minds, right. Ah man!

**Ben** [00:28:47] Most often the answer is, nobody knows. It‚Äôs all in someone‚Äôs head, and the only way that would ever make its way out is if you asked them specifically about it. And to even know who to ask is of course a question. If you‚Äôre just doing inquiry, you‚Äôre just trying to find out what happened, what brought us to this point, so you can figure out how to go from there, how to move on, how to move forward. You almost have to do an archeological dig into the artifacts, into the org charts, into the email threads, just to figure out who was there.

**Anthony** [00:29:58] Right, these artifacts and these behaviors that other people are having around these artifacts, implicit or explicit, they‚Äôre shaping the next person who comes in, and the next person that comes in, or the next decision that‚Äôs made. How did you get away doing this for 15 years? It‚Äôs because the first person did it and never questioned it? Or it wasn‚Äôt hard enough, or it wasn‚Äôt within their‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what I wonder, too, like how many people‚Ä¶ What was special about you and I, that we came in and got rubbed the wrong way by something that had been going on for 15 years. So was it bad if 15 years‚Äô worth of people lived with it for that long? How did we know to change it? Why now? To what? Let‚Äôs go, I‚Äôm on my TOC (Theory of Constraints) right now. Like why did we change this, and why did we change it to what we changed it to? And what was missing that nobody was changing it before? Or maybe we didn‚Äôt notice that they were crashing against the rocks of the organizational inertia, I don‚Äôt know.

**Ben** [00:31:06] I mean there is a notion of agitation here though, too. So you know about Tasshin. And Tasshin is a Buddhist monk. He‚Äôs really into the Theory of Constraints, all this kind of stuff. But one of the things he talks about is this thing called Burja Mapping, and Burja Mapping is a way to think about power dynamics in organizations, and really how to‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a way to think and model a system of social dynamics and power dynamics. But one of the aspects that he talks about is the difference between live and dead players. Dead players are basically following a script, and sometimes that‚Äôs very good to be doing, whereas live players are often breaking scripts and writing their own. And that is also great for certain circumstances, and all this kind of stuff. And it‚Äôs not like a binary thing. I think it‚Äôs probably more of a gradient kind of dynamic. But when you talk about, like, ‚ÄúWhat is it that‚Äôs keeping the things going?‚Äù is that you have a lot of people following scripts, and then there‚Äôs the agitator, the heretic. I think that‚Äôs kind of the role that you played‚Ä¶ Maybe what happened was that there was a pocket of progressively more heretical individuals in this organization. And what that enabled was, those people bringing in other people that were even more heretical.

**Anthony** [00:32:32] It was kind of by chance then, even.

**Ben** [00:32:35] Well yeah. I mean everything is by chance, maybe.

**Anthony** [00:32:38] That‚Äôs probably true, right?

**Ben** [00:32:39] But at the same time, you were particularly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna use the word ‚Äúagitating,‚Äù but I mean it in a good way. You‚Äôre looking at this system and going, ‚ÄúWhat!? Like, what are you doing? This doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Why would you do that to that person?‚Äù All that kind of stuff didn‚Äôt make sense to you.

**Anthony** [00:32:59] And that‚Äôs what it comes down to it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ And I think this is hard for even the best operator‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not, ‚ÄúThis is bad, morally.‚Äù Like, you‚Äôre doing something‚Ä¶ Although maybe that is sometimes the first inclination. Maybe it‚Äôs more phrased like, ‚ÄúThis is wrong technically.‚Äù But how do I know that, right. ‚ÄúWell because you‚Äôre hurting people.‚Äù But like you talked about in the episode I listened to, the process that occurred at the end of a release that someone had to take home on their laptop right and fight all weekend‚Ä¶ How can you do this to people? How can you let this person perform this process at the end of the release for years and years on end? Chewing up weekends when it was an rsync. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so frustrating. It‚Äôs not even new stuff right. It wasn‚Äôt new technology. It wasn‚Äôt some creative endeavor. Like if anybody took a minute to write it down, they would have been like, ‚ÄúWhat are we? We‚Äôre asking who to do what? How many times? When?‚Äù I think it would‚Äôve been so obvious. But it‚Äôs hard to go back and think about it like that.

**Ben** [00:34:08] Anthony, thank you so much for coming on and talking to me. I really appreciate your time, and I‚Äôm so glad that we got to talk a little bit about software and systems and humans and all this wonderful stuff. How can people find out more about you? How can people ask you questions and things?

**Anthony** [00:34:26] Don‚Äôt, hahaha. I‚Äôm @AnthonyMastrean, and I‚Äôm sure Ben will put the link somewhere. That‚Äôs probably the best way to get to me right now. I have a bad web site that‚Äôs got garbage on it. I‚Äôm constantly hoping to update those materials, right‚Ä¶

**Ben** [00:34:44] It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs kind of a metaphor for software.

**Anthony** [00:34:48] It really is, right. That‚Äôs not gonna do it.

**Ben** [00:34:52] All right, thanks man. I‚Äôll put a link to all the things in the show notes.

**Anthony** [00:34:57] Cool
