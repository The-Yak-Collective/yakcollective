<h2>Transcript</h2>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:00:00] Hello
everybody and welcome to episode 2 of the Hired Thought podcast. I am very
happy to be joined today by Anthony Mastrean. He and I go way back. We worked
together at an old organization. He taught me a lot of things, and I like to
think that we have a lot of interesting stories to tell. Anthony tell us a
little bit about yourself. Where are you right now in this wonderful world.?</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:00:23] Hey
Ben, I&#8217;m actually working from home these days which is&#8230; man, it&#8217;s really
screwing me up for future employment. I don&#8217;t know if I can go back to somebody
else&#8217;s office in any capacity. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:00:39] Do
you have a kid in each arm while you&#8217;re working every morning, is that how it
works? </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:00:41] Yeah
well that&#8217;s a big part of it. I&#8217;ve got two little ones, so occasionally they&#8217;re
my pair programmers or office partners, if you want to call them that. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:00:51] Family
mob programming I guess. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:00:53] Right.
Yeah. So maybe in a couple of years when they&#8217;re in public school for most the
day, that might change things, but&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:00:58] So
you&#8217;re working from home. We met when we were working at McKesson. We were
working on pharmacy systems and doing kind of like lots of interesting stuff
there. I guess let&#8217;s talk through the origin story just a little bit. I think I
first met you at devopsdays Pittsburgh 2014. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:01:22] Yeah
there was a&#8230; I think of that as the year of serendipity. There was a lot of
meetings and and happenings and like intellectual things occurring for myself,
I don&#8217;t know, maybe for Pittsburgh? It&#8217;s hard to claim anything for an entire
region. But there was definitely some stuff starting that year. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:01:40] Yeah,
let&#8217;s claim it for Pittsburgh. Let&#8217;s claim it for you, too. So tell me a little
bit about that though. What was going on that year for you? </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:01:49]
[00:01:49]I think the way I like to describe it to I don&#8217;t I don&#8217;t know
whether to be cheeky or introspective. I think I became like a reluctant devop
or something like that. [11.8s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:02:02] [00:02:02]The
lone reluctant devop. [1.0s]</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:02:05]
[00:02:05]Was it reluctant, or is it&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, I had had
enough of just normal application development, which is funny, &#8217;cause that&#8217;s
where&#8230; that&#8217;s the meat of this industry. So many developers developing right.
Yet there&#8217;s so much more work to be done. And I think I either accidentally or
kind of subconsciously found myself constantly drawn to that other stuff. The
things that happened, not just before you start jamming on the keyboard, you
know what&#8217;s up with work planning, you know? Or organization of teams? Or is
this a JIRA ticket? Like what kind of system are we using? Right but like even
after all that, right OK, we&#8217;ve got this code? Where&#8217;s it going? Is there a
build?. Are there tests? Should you test first? Is the build passing? Has it
been red for four months, like you know all these things. What about
deployment. Who&#8217;s deploying this? And where and how are those environments
managed? You know even down a little bit, like where am I committing this code
to? Who&#8217;s server is running source control? It&#8217;s actually a desktop under
someone&#8217;s desk&#8230; There&#8217;s all of these questions I think that surround
development that&#8230;&nbsp; I think a lot of
people make a lot of it, like &#8220;well,&nbsp;
you know, developers ought to understand all that.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s
like the Twitter version of the job, right. Sure. All you, you know, blue
checkmark people on Twitter saying that developers should know all this. That&#8217;s
different than the thousands of people we&#8217;ve all worked with who don&#8217;t work
like that. So there&#8217;s this massive gap. [105.1s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:03:52] [00:03:52]You
can point at all sorts of stuff, like how do people learn? How is it that you
are supposed to have come by those skills, by that knowledge? And the reality
is, I think in a lot of especially enterprise organizations, and perhaps
enterprise organizations in Pittsburgh, in particular&#8230; Maybe I&#8217;m being a
little bit too broad sweeping here, but I think there is a tendency to create
bubbles and stay within them. And if you are doing any migrating it&#8217;s maybe
between bubbles every couple of years, and they&#8217;re all such small bubbles that
they&#8217;re missing the larger picture of the larger changes in practice. What do
you think is at the center of that? Is it just we&#8217;re not learning when we
should be learning? Or if we should know that stuff and all the blue checkmark
people are telling us that, like OK, but how? And why? And when? [56.5s]</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:04:48]
[00:04:48]I guess it&#8217;s interesting maybe to use Pittsburgh as a foil. I
don&#8217;t think we have any Thiel organizations right here in Pittsburgh, if you
want to think of the wackiest organizations that are out there somewhere. So
what we&#8217;ve got going on is very traditional right. Like, well, we need project
management, so we&#8217;ve got a project management office. Well those developers
just need to be developing, wo we&#8217;ve got the test group, and they&#8217;re probably
offshore still. It&#8217;s 2019, and we still have offshore test groups. Or, well,
the developers need to develop, so we need to have&#8230; well who&#8217;s going to put
all that software together? Well let&#8217;s have a configuration management group,
right, and let&#8217;s have a build release team. Certainly we have operators, right,
and they&#8217;ve got their own V.P. of operations, like there is no direct line
between developers and operations so&#8230; I hesitate to say these things just
exist because they exist right. I don&#8217;t want to give a tautalogical answer but,
man, these things just seem to exist. I don&#8217;t know&#8230; I don&#8217;t think we have
enough&#8230; we need to bring the anthropologists in, and say, &#8220;Why, why did
we do this? Tell us, because we can&#8217;t see it. We&#8217;re too close to it to to
understand why they exist let alone how to change it, in some cases. These are
the systems of rewards and incentives and, I mean how about just job
descriptions?[78.3s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:06:08] [00:06:08]Oh
don&#8217;t even get me started [0.0s]</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:06:09]
[00:06:09]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve encountered plenty of these team members, right.
You know, the developer, the CM guy, the whatever, who&#8230; maybe they even want
to grow beyond what they&#8217;re doing now, but, boy, it&#8217;s not in the performance
review system. So, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to cross that line.&#8221; It&#8217;s too scary
in a way. There&#8217;s too much risk in doing that. [20.1s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:06:30] You
have to take on a lot of risk as an individual to attempt to be&#8230; essentially
an anomaly, right? If the rest of the organization is aiming for uniformity&#8230; [00:06:42]It&#8217;s interesting that you mention job
descriptions, because my whole thing with that is&#8230; tell me how you are going
to describe exactly the kind of person that you want to bring in, as if it&#8217;s a
part that you can go down to a shop and&#8230; &#8220;I need part CL-732, and I need
it in this configuration and as part of this warranty package.&#8221; All that
kind of stuff as if it&#8217;s a fungible thing you just plug in. [22.8s]</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:07:05]
[00:07:05]Yeah. Like, how dare you describe a complex job with very
simple statements in a job description. Right? [7.5s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:07:15] [00:07:15]When
I was looking for work, and really before we started working together, and even
after and later stages in my career, I was just looking at job descriptions.
And the problem for me was constantly trying to project a version of myself
that might fit into some of these boxes, and I just found that to be an
impossible kind of idea. Because one, they&#8217;re not describing it, remotely. Like
phenomenologically they are not describing the thing. They are describing an
idealized version of the thing, which is not even&#8230; that doesn&#8217;t exist. [34.6s]</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:07:51]
[00:07:51]I&#8217;m always going to get this wrong, but there&#8217;s a fellow out
there, Steven Shorrock. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s his idea or not, but he often
comes back to this concept that there are overlapping and non overlapping
things, like work as design, work as described, work as understood. And these
things very rarely and in very small parts ever overlap. So you have the job
description, it&#8217;s like wow, it&#8217;s&#8230; And who the hell wrote this thing too,
right? That probably has a big effect as well. Is it what we want the job to
be? Is it what the job is? Is it what I think the job is? Like there&#8217;s so
many&#8230; Or is it what I think will get candidates in for the job? Like it&#8217;s
just such nonsense. [43.4s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:08:35] It&#8217;s
so multi-dimensional, and I think this shows up everywhere, right? I guess the
kind of joke here is at one point I was helping write job descriptions. When I
worked with the state of PA, we needed to hire sysadmins, and I won&#8217;t say that
that was my responsibility, but I was certainly contributing to that. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:08:54] Like,
&#8220;I can do this better,&#8221; right? &#8220;I can help make this
improvement.&#8221; And maybe you do, within an axis. Like, within whatever
version of the job description that you thought the job description should be.
Maybe you did make it better but&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:09:07] That&#8217;s
our pathology I think, is we show up and go, &#8220;OK. The system seems to
be&#8230; like, it&#8217;s working, clearly, but it&#8217;s also causing a lot of pain.&#8221;
Like there are a lot of bones being ground up in the middle of it.</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:09:18] Yeah,
so I think it was&#8230; lots of accidents, right? Like I started my career at
FedEx. And talk about all the syndromes that any organization could have, it
was there. There&#8217;s pigeonholed development, offshore testing, a CM team. A team
that was responsible for &#8220;the builds,&#8221; the golden images and such.
And towards the end of my run there, it was so&#8230; I didn&#8217;t even know whether to
call it dysfunctional or not because actually we made it functional by&#8230; At
some point someone sent the CM team a script to build the software, because the
CM team didn&#8217;t even write the scripts, right. They just ran the scripts to
build the software. And at some point the script we gave them just printed,
&#8220;success.&#8221; And then a senior architect went off and actually did the
build and release separately. So again, dysfunctional or functional? I don&#8217;t
even know how to describe&#8230; So there was some formative stuff going on there,
at least. Here&#8217;s how some big organizations can operate. I won&#8217;t say that was
all of them, but it sure did&#8230; it looked like a thing. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:10:28] Well
I mean we like our process. We like having little boxes to check off as we go
along. But I think the thing that I learned while working with you a bit, and
really the lesson that&#8217;s been reinforced over and over again as I&#8217;ve been
finding my way into larger organizations working in a consulting and support
capacity&#8230; I just see how much all this stuff is just made up. We are
constructing reality around us to the extent that someone else has to construct
an interface to that reality. Like the script example you just gave, &#8220;Oh
this person will be nervous if they don&#8217;t have this part of their process to
check off.&#8221; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:11:14] Or
they might not have a job, which I mean, understandable, but like, is that a
good reason? I think at McKesson it was interesting. [00:11:24]So
I came in, the team was called Software Configuration Management. Like what is
that? That terminology is really old, except maybe&#8230; it might only be old to
the coasts, right? Like a lot of businesses in the middle of the country still
have a thing called SCM. And I actually think it&#8217;s still a discipline. I think
there are topic areas and there are knowledge areas there, and there are
patterns and practices, and I hesitate to maybe even say best practices for
Software Configuration Management. And oh man, I&#8217;m about to be like so, what is
the word, well, I&#8217;m going to be cheesy. Like, this job shouldn&#8217;t exist, right?
So I joined this weird place. Not a developer. Which actually I&#8217;m happy,
because the software system we were working on, this 15-year-old Java Swing
application, boy&#8230; I really don&#8217;t want to jump into that. But I could jump in
on the edge of that, in the SCM team. So here, run the Subversion server.
Babysit the builds. Handle the build and release process. So now I was that guy
that I was previously handing empty scripts to. But could we effect change?
Could we come in, and again, cheesy as it may sound, this job doesn&#8217;t need to
exist. Developers are already doing this work right, or they&#8217;re so close to it.
You know, and to hint at the Wardley side of things, why can&#8217;t we commoditize
these things. Like, you&#8217;re branching strategy ought not to be creative. Your
build system should not be bespoke, in most cases for line of business apps.
Like literally, why does this job exist? Let&#8217;s buy a couple of cloud services,
whether that&#8217;s some Bitbucket stuff, some GitLab stuff, some JIRA stuff. Just
buy something. Buy something, follow a &#8220;best practice&#8221; Follow a
decent practice that&#8217;s probably way better than what you&#8217;re doing now, maybe
not the best, but the job doesn&#8217;t need to exist. But you know what job that
does need to exist? The Agitator that gets everybody to change to the commodity
thing. [121.7s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:13:26] Yeah
I think that&#8217;s the key part of this. It&#8217;s the transition between&#8230; I think all
these systems that we build tend to try to maintain what already is working and
what already exists&#8230; The Known. And it&#8217;s working, so we should just keep
doing it, right? </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:13:41] Right,
it&#8217;s working but it&#8217;s leaving&#8230; Look at the damage it&#8217;s leaving in its wake.
And I don&#8217;t think, me 10 years ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have been talking like this. I
think maybe I was on the same path technically, but I was less focused on the
people side. I didn&#8217;t see it, maybe because 10 years ago I had boundless energy
and whatnot. But like nowadays it&#8217;s like, man, we&#8217;re just killing people. These
jobs are killing people! You know we could do so much better and unleash their
capacity. And emotional capacity, too. Not just like, &#8220;Boy, we can get
more stories done.&#8221; &#8220;Boy, we can make people feel more valuable.&#8221;
And if that valuability adds value to the company let&#8217;s go for it. I think
those two things are intertwined. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:14:27] The
change that has occurred over&#8230; there&#8217;s kind of a leapfrog moment, right,
where you have the option to&#8230; If you&#8217;re not going to stay incrementally in
step with the change that is going on around you, the evolution if you will, of
things that are practices, patterns, the technology, all that kind of stuff. If
you&#8217;re not going to stay in step with that, or even anticipate it, if you&#8217;re
not gonna do that, you&#8217;re gonna fall behind. So I don&#8217;t know exactly how to
describe this kind of transition should happen in general, but I think it&#8217;s
useful to have a momentary transitionary role, where you go from&#8230; I mean what
was the state of SCM before, before there was a centralized&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:15:16] Tickets
were open for three years. Builds were red for four weeks at a time. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:15:21] Yeah.
</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:15:22] It&#8217;s
funny a lot of it&#8217;s technical stuff, right. As a new person into this
organization, which I think is desperately what this organization needed. The
new guy at this organization had been there for nine years. And I apol- I know
I&#8217;m saying guy a lot. But like literally, that&#8217;s just who they were. But nine
years, there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re going to come in&#8230; you&#8217;re already taken away,
you&#8217;re floating with the system at that point. So to be dropped in and to see
that, to be able to see, &#8220;Oh that build has literally been red for 4
weeks. This ticket in my backlog now has been open for three years. Close it or
fix it or something!&#8221; But that&#8217;s easy for me to say, because I&#8217;m not here
with all the organizational, emotional baggage of it how it needs to close
that. I think maybe that&#8217;s important too. [00:16:15]This
journey it&#8217;s not just technical. These people were shipping successful
software, you know maybe not as fast as they could, which we found out later.
We were able to ship much faster. So they were useful, technical, savvy
individuals. So I think the problem was probably not like, &#8220;Oh we just
needed someone to come in and figure Puppet out. Do this migration from SVN to
GitLab or whatever.&#8221; A lot of people could do that. But a lot of the work
was, &#8220;How do we bring these people along with us?&#8221; They&#8217;re scared. Like
literally people were scared. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we can do it this way. I&#8217;m
nervous about that, either because we&#8217;re gonna lose work, or we&#8217;re going to
break something, or it&#8217;s just going to hurt. What if we mess up? And then I&#8217;ve
got to go backwards, or I have to learn something new. I&#8217;m so comfortable with
the way we&#8217;re doing it now.&#8221; [53.2s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:17:10] The
performance improvement situation as well. You are evaluated based on
commitments that you made three quarters ago. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:17:17] A
year ago.</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:17:19] What
is&#8230; How!? You actually cannot change, unless you adopt a mentality and have
the support structure that is able to look at that and go, &#8220;Yeah, well
duh. This should have changed.&#8221; I think in some ways we had some luck
there where some people were a little bit more willing to go along with the
malleability of that. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:17:40] I
believe our team was vacant for something like six to nine months. The previous
folks had&#8230; I think it was a year that the last proper SCM person had quit.
Someone had stepped in part time to manage things. So obviously that wasn&#8217;t
going to be a huge change. And then it was literally vacant. So there was no
CM. And again, well so CM shouldn&#8217;t exist, but in this context it desperately
needed to exist. So yeah, we came in, and I think we came into a total&#8230; I
don&#8217;t know how to recreate this or even if I should&#8230; But we had a new
manager, a new director, a new VP, the president changed. This whole business
unit down to our stupid little seats in the cube farm changed in weeks. So our
performance review was not the same one that was happening to these folks who&#8217;d
been there for 15 years. There&#8217;s lots and lots of things right. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:18:39] Yeah
I mean that was wild, because on the one hand we could literally shape the way
that we could do the work, the way that we thought that it should be done. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:18:52] Yeah
it was easy to come in and say, &#8220;This is not how CM works&#8221; even
though I didn&#8217;t know that. Like I wasn&#8217;t sure. It was my first CM job. Like
what even is CM right? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to say. Really accidentally
joined the team this way in a position I&#8217;ve never formerly held. Is CM even
taught? There&#8217;s like one book that I know of. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:19:12] I
remember you like going into all these places on the Internet, just trying to
dig and dig and dig&#8230; like, &#8220;What is branching even?&#8221;&nbsp; Not just asking what branching strategy
should we use, like what&#8217;s popular. It was more like, &#8220;What is this
even?&#8221; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:19:27] Like
what even yeah&#8230; This is the craziest thing about software development. And I
guess a lot of people say, &#8220;Oh but it&#8217;s a young discipline.&#8221; But we
don&#8217;t actually know for sure, evidence-wise. We don&#8217;t know that source control
is good. Like prove&#8230; I know that it&#8217;s good, I feel good when I&#8217;m using it,
but we don&#8217;t have anything like&#8230; There&#8217;s no study, there&#8217;s no pedagogy,
there&#8217;s not like&#8230; all of these hundred dollar words. Like we don&#8217;t know why
what we do should be done&#8230; what to do, why we should do it, how we should do
it, we really don&#8217;t. We have a lot of stories right now. Maybe that&#8217;s how every
industry like this starts. We don&#8217;t have 5000 years of history programming
computers, but maybe someday we will. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:20:16] I
get really excited when I see some case studies about something. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:20:21] Yeah
oh, we only have stories, but at least let&#8217;s bring 10 of them together in one
paper. Can I make sense of any of this? </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:20:28] Somebody
trying to do some analysis to figure out what makes sense here, what makes
there. It&#8217;s largely expert based. You have people who we look to as the gods of
the industry, if you will. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:20:41] Yeah.
That&#8217;s problematic. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:20:45] That&#8217;s
the way, it&#8217;s the blue checkmark people. Here they are. Here&#8217;s the answer. And
they&#8217;re largely giving experiential anecdotal evidence, and I&#8217;m just thinking
of&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:20:56] And
from a very unique perspective. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:20:58] Yeah
totally! </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:20:58] Right,
that&#8217;s the thing. Like the blue checkmark consultant, agile consultant, or
whatever, devops&#8230; Like these people are already in a totally different
context than the 30 of us that have been sitting on this team for the last
three years just trying to do whatever it is we&#8217;re doing. There&#8217;s no&#8230; I like
what the folks are doing with the State of DevOps report. And of course we&#8217;re
going to go there, right. Like how you&#8217;ve got PhDs and scientists and
statisticians. You know you&#8217;ve got serious people doing serious work on this industry
that is sorely lacking anything that&#8217;s serious. But I struggle with that, like
a lot of this stuff comes out which is just like &#8220;Just do Trunk Based
Development.&#8221; OK. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:21:45] &#8220;Just.&#8221;
</p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:21:45] And
then what. Or how do I even&#8230; Like, what do you mean, &#8220;just do Trunk
Based Development?&#8221; We literally, I think we had&#8230; something on the order
of 60 branches when we got there. And it was like, major, minor, patch, and
hotfix. And I think we ran the numbers once, and we had like an average of 17
hot fixes. We contractually promised a major, two minors, and like three patch
versions. If you did the math on that, we were supporting forty five versions
of the software at once. We were doing it through, or you know the team, you
know the &#8220;we&#8221; that was there at the time, we were doing it through
whatever branching strategy we could figure out. You can&#8217;t just like&#8230; these
people on Twitter and there 120 characters at the time. &#8220;Just do Trunk
Based Development. Good luck.&#8221; &#8220;Thanks a lot. You&#8217;re an
asshole.&#8221; Like you can&#8217;t do anything with that. You know? </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:22:50] I
think that&#8217;s it. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:22:51] It&#8217;s
so frustrating. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:22:52] It&#8217;s
always advice, right. I get that in order to move things forward, you have to
work at the edge, in the sense that you have to point at something that is&#8230;
If you&#8217;re starting from nothing, you could probably consider starting here.
That seems reasonable. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:23:08] Right.
Definitely. If you were starting with nothing, right. That&#8217;s great. And I think
there&#8217;s even like, there&#8217;s stuff out there, man. I&#8217;m just constantly impressed
by GitLab. Like just go get GitLab. Like, just buy it. The entire thing they&#8217;ve
got this whole&#8230; I know this is not an advertisement for GitLab but the
concept like&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:23:27] If
they want to sponsor&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:23:27] There&#8217;s
a team who&#8217;s producing tooling for you, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;We want to
take care of the entire process, the entire lifecycle of software from planning
to designing to developing to capturing issues to doing ops. We&#8217;re gonna give
you a tool kit. Now, it has opinions. It works in a certain situation. Some of
those tools are different maturity levels.&#8221; But the fact that they even
published a maturity chart for each of their features *mind explosion noise* is
really great. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:23:54] I
think that&#8217;s really important to have that kind of structure in place, because
the defaults that you get are&#8230; if they&#8217;re not perfect, that&#8217;s fine. But
they&#8217;re at least sensible and principled probably. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:24:05] And
they&#8217;re at least not 15 years of custom scripts tying together custom
processes. At least you&#8217;re moving from something structured. Hopefully to
something else structured but that is a better choice for whatever your context
is. And that&#8217;s again why it&#8217;s so frustrating to get this advice. Or another one
that I love is like, &#8220;Just do feature flags.&#8221; So how do I move to
Trunk Based Development when I&#8217;ve got release-per-branch, I&#8217;ve got 45 releases
that I&#8217;m contractually obligated to maintain, I can&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;m a CM guy. I can&#8217;t
make this corporation decide to contract their software differently. Right. We
eventually did, but only because we had that whole management chain entwined in
this. &#8220;Hey how can we actually produce software faster.&#8221; &#8220;Well
stop promising that we&#8217;re going to support forty five versions.&#8221; That idea
came from us, but it was enacted by them, they talked to legal and sales and
everything. So that is doable, but on a much longer timescale. So okay how do I
get to Trunk Based Development now that that&#8217;s my, okay great, that&#8217;s my holy
grail. How do I get there? &#8220;Well just do feature flags.&#8221; Well that&#8217;s
not like&#8230;. Have you ever done feature flags? It doesn&#8217;t mean one thing. It&#8217;s
complicated at best. You just gotta turn stuff on and off? Well feature flags
means you&#8217;ve got to really have your configuration sorted out, and that
configuration now has to be exposed. Is that feature flags to the user, to an
admin, to an operator? Who gets the feature flag? Where do they toggle it? How
are you toggling? You really gotta have your dependency injection sorted out.
What the hell is dependency injection? You have to unwind all of the job. You
know, but just use feature flags dot com. So frustrating, this entire job. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:25:50] There&#8217;s
there&#8217;s so much work to be done to help people adopt practices from a
standpoint of&#8230; you&#8217;re starting with what already exists. And actually finding
a path from that, do something sensible that&#8217;s&#8230; not even just sensible,
because it all makes sense, right. Even the legacy, if you will, makes sense. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:26:11] Right,
like, it can&#8217;t be irrational if it got done by human beings and it was sold.
You know what I mean, and I think a lot of people like to throw that around
like, &#8220;Oh we&#8217;re not rational hahaha. Like randomness, you know.&#8221; No
no. I think what rational means is that you&#8217;re reasoning. We are always
reasoning, whether or not we&#8217;re coming up with the right answer or the best
answer or whatever. But I think everybody was reasoning all along, right. These
15 years, that transition from startup, to corporation, I think the team was
bought and sold three or four times. [00:26:49]Everybody&#8217;s
reasoning. Throughout all the different performance management programs, all
the different changes in methodology, they&#8217;re reasoning all along the way. So I
think we gotta be careful with that, that we&#8217;re not just harming people while
we&#8217;re trying to unharm people. Like, &#8220;You idiots did that.&#8221; No, it&#8217;s
like &#8220;We did this thing, obviously. But maybe we can do a little bit of a
different thing.&#8221; [26.1s]</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:27:18] This
is probably a weird place to go with this but the thing that I heard Jabe
(@cyetain) say recently&#8230; We had a really interesting conversation with Sue
Borchardt (@contemplatethis) about&#8230; It was focused on on some things that
Jabe was tweeting about, but one of the things he mentioned was like Janus
time. The god of transition, the two faces. When you&#8217;re changing, you are
literally in both the future state and the previous past state at the same
time, and you&#8217;re trying to reconcile both of those things together. Just
hearing that was like, &#8220;Ohhhh, right. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so hard.&#8221;
Because we have to be of two minds at once. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I have
a hard time being of one mind at any one given point in time, let alone&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:28:08] Right.
Right. And in part, you&#8217;re also, like we talked about earlier, you&#8217;re in the
mind of the thing that you&#8217;re trying to change, too. The thing was brought
together by how many people&#8230; We call it the organization, because it&#8217;s hard
to&#8230; Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to literally know. I don&#8217;t know who to blame for
this, to go ask them, &#8220;What were you thinking and why? And what were all
the forces on you?&#8221; No, at some point we just have a shortcut. The
organization made this, maybe you understand what was going on in the
organization at the time. So now you&#8217;re of two minds, you&#8217;re reflecting on the
other minds, right. Ah man! </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:28:47] Most
often the answer is, nobody knows. It&#8217;s all in someone&#8217;s head, and the only way
that would ever make its way out is if you asked them specifically about it.
And to even know who to ask is of course a question. If you&#8217;re just doing
inquiry, you&#8217;re just trying to find out what happened, what brought us to this
point, so you can figure out how to go from there, how to move on, how to move
forward. You almost have to do an archeological dig into the artifacts, into
the org charts, into the email threads, just to figure out who was there. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:29:58] Right, these artifacts and these behaviors that other people are having around these artifacts, implicit or explicit, they&#8217;re shaping the next person who comes in, and the next person that comes in, or the next decision that&#8217;s made. How did you get away doing this for 15 years? It&#8217;s because the first person did it and never questioned it? Or it wasn&#8217;t hard enough, or it wasn&#8217;t within their&#8230; That&#8217;s what I wonder, too, like how many people&#8230; What was special about you and I, that we came in and got rubbed the wrong way by something that had been going on for 15 years. So was it bad if 15 years&#8217; worth of people lived with it for that long? How did we know to change it? Why now? To what? Let&#8217;s go, I&#8217;m on my TOC (Theory of Constraints) right now. Like why did we change this, and why did we change it to what we changed it to? And what was missing that nobody was changing it before? Or maybe we didn&#8217;t notice that they were crashing against the rocks of the organizational inertia, I don&#8217;t know. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:31:06] I mean there is a notion of agitation here though, too. So you know about Tasshin. And Tasshin is a Buddhist monk. He&#8217;s really into the Theory of Constraints, all this kind of stuff. But one of the things he talks about is this thing called Burja Mapping, and Burja Mapping is a way to think about power dynamics in organizations, and really how to&#8230; It&#8217;s a way to think and model a system of social dynamics and power dynamics. But one of the aspects that he talks about is the difference between live and dead players. Dead players are basically following a script, and sometimes that&#8217;s very good to be doing, whereas live players are often breaking scripts and writing their own. And that is also great for certain circumstances, and all this kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s not like a binary thing. I think it&#8217;s probably more of a gradient kind of dynamic. But when you talk about, like, &#8220;What is it that&#8217;s keeping the things going?&#8221; is that you have a lot of people following scripts, and then there&#8217;s the agitator, the heretic. I think that&#8217;s kind of the role that you played&#8230; Maybe what happened was that there was a pocket of progressively more heretical individuals in this organization. And what that enabled was, those people bringing in other people that were even more heretical. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:32:32] It was kind of by chance then, even. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:32:35] Well yeah. I mean everything is by chance, maybe. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:32:38] That&#8217;s probably true, right? </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:32:39] But at the same time, you were particularly&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna use the word &#8220;agitating,&#8221; but I mean it in a good way. You&#8217;re looking at this system and going, &#8220;What!? Like, what are you doing? This doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Why would you do that to that person?&#8221; All that kind of stuff didn&#8217;t make sense to you. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:32:59] And that&#8217;s what it comes down to it&#8217;s not&#8230; And I think this is hard for even the best operator&#8230; It&#8217;s not, &#8220;This is bad, morally.&#8221; Like, you&#8217;re doing something&#8230; Although maybe that is sometimes the first inclination. Maybe it&#8217;s more phrased like, &#8220;This is wrong technically.&#8221; But how do I know that, right. &#8220;Well because you&#8217;re hurting people.&#8221; But like you talked about in the episode I listened to, the process that occurred at the end of a release that someone had to take home on their laptop right and fight all weekend&#8230; How can you do this to people? How can you let this person perform this process at the end of the release for years and years on end? Chewing up weekends when it was an rsync. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s so frustrating. It&#8217;s not even new stuff right. It wasn&#8217;t new technology. It wasn&#8217;t some creative endeavor. Like if anybody took a minute to write it down, they would have been like, &#8220;What are we? We&#8217;re asking who to do what? How many times? When?&#8221; I think it would&#8217;ve been so obvious. But it&#8217;s hard to go back and think about it like that. </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:34:08] Anthony, thank you so much for coming on and talking to me. I really appreciate your time, and I&#8217;m so glad that we got to talk a little bit about software and systems and humans and all this wonderful stuff. How can people find out more about you? How can people ask you questions and things? </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:34:26] Don&#8217;t, hahaha. I&#8217;m @AnthonyMastrean, and I&#8217;m sure Ben will put the link somewhere. That&#8217;s probably the best way to get to me right now. I have a bad web site that&#8217;s got garbage on it. I&#8217;m constantly hoping to update those materials, right&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:34:44] It&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s kind of a metaphor for software. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:34:48] It really is, right. That&#8217;s not gonna do it.</p>



<p><strong>Ben </strong>[00:34:52] All right, thanks man. I&#8217;ll put a link to all the things in the show notes. </p>



<p><strong>Anthony </strong>[00:34:57] Cool </p>
