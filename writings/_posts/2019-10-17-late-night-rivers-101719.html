<p>I. <br></p><p>World, <br></p><p>please swallow me whole, like a dead fish washed up on that shore, baked with open fly wounds and glittery scales scattered. take me back, into that tide of movement and belonging, an integrated member of an ecosystem: me, a posthumous exile.</p><p>i keep telling myself,<em> first one must die. then you can live: reborn and relive.</em></p><p>i must fight, hold tight to the enthusiasm of an adolescent carrying a bleeding heart and an open wrist. a tinge of loss, an acknowledgement of pain, a reminder that you are alive. there is a fighting light, even if it is flickering.</p><p>a feeling of existential seamlessness in the flesh, seeking corporeal freedom and a salt bath to assault the wound of derealization. when we are dehydrated, we drink electrolytes. <br></p><p>II. <br></p><p>Sweetheart, <br></p><p>I want to dance, slowly and in-fixed per a smothering silence, our heartbeats setting the tempo as our feet scatter and shuffle without a fatigued consciousness: mesmerized sufferers of that ineffable feeling which is as certain as the constant backdrop of ocean waves, moonlight.</p><p>our corporeal senses, realities &#8211;&#8211; attributes of disease, mortality, and moles &#8211;&#8211; melting against and into a more cosmic groundedness. our origins and stories no longer matter. we are as naked and uniform as humbled atoms before the galactic expanse. our language is finally at rest, the dance we had been rehearsing for all along. <br></p><p>i would like to enter this sublime submission, a divine thing to be graced with in a short life, with the likes of you. the free body diagram of introspective forces within a person's interiority coming to a final rest, a resolve. our persons, yours. <br></p><p>our hammock swaying in that wind long after our bodies evaporate back into the atmosphere, breathing life to new constellations: a hydrating realization, our tight embrace. <br></p>
