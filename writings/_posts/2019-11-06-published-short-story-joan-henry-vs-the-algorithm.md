A few weeks back, I had a short story published for the first time! It was included in the [Working Futures](https://workingfutur.es/) anthology, containing sci-fi stories about the future of work. My story is called “Joan Henry vs the Algorithm” and you can also [read it for free](https://randylubin.com/fiction/joan-henry-vs-the-algorithm.html) on my site.

The story hits on a few themes / topics:

- Struggling to reskill in an environment of increasing automation
- Wrestling with whether to keep working in an era of basic income
- What the future of paid interactive storytelling might look like

I had a lot of fun writing it and will hopefully right more short fiction in the future.

Let me know if you read it – I’d love to hear your thoughts!
