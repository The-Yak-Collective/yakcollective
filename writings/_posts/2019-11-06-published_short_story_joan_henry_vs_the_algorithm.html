<p>A few weeks back, I had a short story published for the first time! It was included in the <a href="https://workingfutur.es/">Working Futures</a> anthology, containing sci-fi stories about the future of work. My story is called “Joan Henry vs the Algorithm” and you can also <a href="https://randylubin.com/fiction/joan-henry-vs-the-algorithm.html">read it for free</a> on my site.</p>
<p>The story hits on a few themes / topics:</p>
<ul><li>Struggling to reskill in an environment of increasing automation</li><li>Wrestling with whether to keep working in an era of basic income</li><li>What the future of paid interactive storytelling might look like</li></ul>
<p>I had a lot of fun writing it and will hopefully right more short fiction in the future.</p>
<p>Let me know if you read it – I’d love to hear your thoughts!</p>
