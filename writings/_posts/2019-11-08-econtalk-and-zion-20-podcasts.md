Still getting into a rhythm here in the podcasting world, so I didn’t have an episode for the last two weeks. I don’t have one this week either, but I do have two guest appearances on other people’s podcasts to share, which amount to a couple of hours worth of me talking.

First, I went on [Russ Roberts’ Econtalk podcast to talk about Waldenponding](https://www.econtalk.org/venkatesh-rao-on-waldenponding/), which I’ve written about on this newsletter several times now (the links are on the podcast page, along with several other links you might want to explore).

Second, I went on [Collin Morris’ Zion 2.0 podcast](https://www.zionpod.me/blog/33), which was a much more free-form conversation around themes I write about both here and on ribbonfarm.

It’s an interesting exercise for me to contrast my “home” monologue podcast style with the style I end up adopting in conversation with specific people.

We’ll be back to regular programming with my short-format monologues next week.
