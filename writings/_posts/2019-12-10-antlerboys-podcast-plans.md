I’m finally announcing the launch of TWO podcasts in 2020:

**Transduction** : the systems, complexity, and cybernetics podcast

and

**Joy and work** : the (public) service transformation podcast, _leading transformation_

who \*must\* I have as a guest?

Let me have names — and email addresses — please — or email me at [benjamin.taylor@redquadrant.com](http://mailto:benjamin.taylor@redquadrant.com/)

Or people can go direct:

**STEP ONE**  — scheduling — book a slot here
