<p>Hey folks, sorry for the tardy start to 2020, a year in which I have far too much on my plate, and have had too much random zemblanity coming at me in the Life  &#129324;&#128534;&#128556; Happens department. </p><p>Which means the projects where I have the murkiest intentions/commitments to myself, like this one, are  getting the most derailed. I last sent out a newsletter/podcast on Dec 6, so it&#8217;s been like 7 weeks. I&#8217;m still not yet ready to get going with this year&#8217;s breaking smart (breaking slow?), and this is mostly just a quick Hello-2020 newsletter.</p><p>For the next few months, <strong>I&#8217;m going to slow this thing down to once a month</strong>, while I rebalance activities and commitments. For this week, no original content, but here&#8217;s some stuff from other channels you guys may like.</p><ul><li><p><strong>First</strong>, I went on the Unregistered podcast with Thaddeus Russell, mainly to <a href="http://www.thaddeusrussell.com/podcast/102">talk about my current research on time and temporality</a>. It&#8217;s 90 minutes, so you&#8217;ve been warned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Second</strong>, my post last week on ribbonfarm, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">The Internet of Beefs</a>, went pretty viral, and has strong overlaps with Breaking Smart themes, so you may want to check that out.</p></li></ul><p>I&#8217;ll be back with new stuff hopefully in a few weeks, around February end. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve sat down and brainstormed how to evolve this thing, and I need to do that too, since this thing has admittedly mission-creeped and drifted quite a bit over the years, not to mention gone into deep denial about Season 2, which has supposedly been in the works since 2015 and is now over 3 years late. It&#8217;s like a military contract project at this point. I know many of you would like to know if/when it&#8217;s ever coming out. I would too &#129313;&#129345;. </p><p>But we&#8217;ll get this show back on the road properly at some point.</p>
