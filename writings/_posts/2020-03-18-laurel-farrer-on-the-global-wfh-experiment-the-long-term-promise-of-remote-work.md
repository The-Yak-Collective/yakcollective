Laurel and I decided to jump on a video call to talk about the world emerging work-from-home experiment amid the evolving Covid-19 pandemic. We wanted to talk about some of the deeper principles & opportunities that remote work offers and talk about how companies might think about it in the next month and over the next few years. We talk about:

- The short-term mindset companies should take in the next few weeks (hint: don’t overdo the tools right now)
- What the broader opportunity is for remote work over the next 10 years
- The role of trust in remote work and what happens when it breaks down
- How to think about meetings and how to design your day and re-think productivity
- Examples of companies who have been innovating in this space for 10+ years
- Experience from Laurel’s 10+ years as a remote team leader
