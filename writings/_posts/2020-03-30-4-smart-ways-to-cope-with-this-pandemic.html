We know this is temporary, but it doesn&#8217;t feel that way, and we realize things will be different&#8230; The loss of normalcy; the fear of economic toll; the loss of connection. This is hitting us and we&#8217;re grieving. Collectively. We are not used to this kind of collective grief in the air.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>An interview with grief expert David Kessler on experiencing pandemic as many kinds of loss: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief">That Discomfort You&#8217;re Feeling Is Grief</a></p><h2>4.
