<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>When it comes to a crisis - personal or community, time becomes the ultimate currency. Everything I&#8217;ve been thinking about over the past few days has been around buying more time. As a salary man my current plan is divided into two segments:<br><br>1. Buying more time for the medium term (3-9 months) - this means aggressively saving money and  looking for opportunities in repurposing, upgrading or scaling businesses post-virus. </p><p>2. Looking for signals on what the world will be like 12-18 months from now - Would there be a vaccine by then?
