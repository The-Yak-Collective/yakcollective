> “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.”

When it comes to a crisis - personal or community, time becomes the ultimate currency. Everything I’ve been thinking about over the past few days has been around buying more time. As a salary man my current plan is divided into two segments:  

1. Buying more time for the medium term (3-9 months) - this means aggressively saving money and looking for opportunities in repurposing, upgrading or scaling businesses post-virus.

2. Looking for signals on what the world will be like 12-18 months from now - Would there be a vaccine by then? What technology and sociological shifts should I be paying attention to so that I’m not caught off guard when the post-virus economy kicks off?   

It’s also been a forcing function to think about time differently.  

The s[ense of a foreshortened future](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4166378/)is replaced by a scramble to figure out what the future holds and how I should orient towards it.   

Here are a few curated links that I hope will help orient yourself for the future:

1. [OODA loop](https://taylorpearson.me/ooda-loop/)- The OODA loop was a tool developed by military strategist John Boyd to explain how individuals and organizations can win in uncertain and chaotic environments.
