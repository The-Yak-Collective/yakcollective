<p>Hello Journalers, </p><p>This week I invited you to give your productivity some consideration. </p><p>You don&#8217;t have to report to me - I&#8217;m not your boss! - but even a post-it note&#8217;s worth of writing could really help to clarify what you&#8217;re doing <em><strong>and why</strong></em> at this very weird time.</p><p></p><h3>Prompt</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Facts:</strong>&nbsp;How is your &#8220;productivity&#8221; at the moment? (measured however makes sense for yo&#8230;</p></li></ul>
