Hello subscribers,

I’ll be straight with you: my last post, in its original version, contains errors. There are some redundant paragraphs due to a copy-paste error between my text editor of choice and Substack. I apologize for this.

**You’ll find an edited, fresher version [here](https://shreeda.substack.com/p/germinating-the-systems-of-subroutines).** Unfortunately, I believe the version that hit your inbox last night will not reflect these edits.

Thank you for your patience! If you get a chance to read the updated post, let me know what you think.

Best,

Shreeda
