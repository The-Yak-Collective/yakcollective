<p>Hi there Innovation at Scale readers! I have an announcement today that I think will be of interest to any readers of Innovation at Scale. </p><p>I&#8217;ve been collaborating with <a href="https://yakcollective.org">The Yak Collective</a>, a loose network of independent consultants, and today we published our first collective effort, a deck of 25 creative and unexpected provocations, ideas, and action frameworks to navigate the Covid-19 crisis:<br><strong><a href="https://yakcollective.org/projects/yak-wisdom">Don't Waste the Reboot</a></strong> </p><p><br>The goal is to offer organizations of all sorts &#8212; business, nonprofit, government &#8212; a real and meaningful alternative to traditional mainstream sources of advice, counsel, and intelligence for navigating this crisis. <br></p><p>Please do check it out, and pass it along to people in your organization who could take inspiration from some of our ideas!</p><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2Fef6a903d-91d9-4345-a335-5fbfd15cc81b_1227x676.png"><img style="max-width: 1227px; max-height: 676px;" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2Fef6a903d-91d9-4345-a335-5fbfd15cc81b_1227x676.png" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef6a903d-91d9-4345-a335-5fbfd15cc81b_1227x676.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:676,&quot;width&quot;:1227,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1832626,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007D;" alt=""></a><p>The deck is organized around six core themes: </p><ul><li><p>Response &amp; Learning </p></li><li><p>Experimentation &amp; Innovation</p></li><li><p>Reboot Mental Models</p></li><li><p>Sensemaking &amp; Storytelling </p></li><li><p>Complexity &amp; Resilience </p></li><li><p>Deploying Indies  </p></li></ul><p>My contribution to this deck is Idea #1, Responsiveness &gt; Preparedness. You can find it on slide 13, including a brief case study about <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/heb-prepared-coronavirus-pandemic/">H-E-B&#8217;s COVID response</a>, which you might recall from a previous issue of this newsletter. </p><p>There are lots of other interesting and challenging ideas in the deck; a few personal highlights for me were:</p><ul><li><p><em>Designing for Continuous Adaptation</em> by Vaughn Tan, which offers organizational responses to the &#8220;succession of new normals&#8221; that will follow the present crisis</p></li><li><p><em>Surfing on the "Edge of Chaos"</em> by Paul Millerd, which offers insights on how to design an organization as a &#8220;complex adaptive system&#8221;</p></li><li><p><em>Restructure as a Small-World Network </em>by Vinay D&#233;brou, about the sweet spot between disparate bets and tightly coupled strategies when planning for uncertain futures</p></li><li><p><em>Reverse Anthropology</em> by Jordan Allen, about the role that outside viewpoints can play in driving organizational change<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>About The Yak Collective</strong></p><p>The Yak collective is a network of independent consultants who all have their own consulting practices, but also work together on larger projects.
