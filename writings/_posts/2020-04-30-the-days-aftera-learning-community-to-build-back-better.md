_Over 50 organisations have already joined the build back better learning community, including housing associations, charities, health, police, local and central government._

We’ve been dynamic in dealing with the crisis — amazing things have been achieved.  
_How do we learn from these breakthroughs?_

Things are still chaotic and confusing! And will be for some time as the ramifications continue.  
_How do we make sense of things right now and for the future?_

_How do we prepare for a real reboot in ‘the days after’ the crisis?_

We have been working with some core organisations to start to think about these questions — and are now expanding to set up a wider learning community. There is no obligation and no charge. This is a place to share and build learning together.

The group will meet fortnightly online, 2–3.30pm on Wednesdays.

The first virtual round table will take place on 13 May, and address the question: **what will we face in ‘the days after’?**  
This will be an active online scenario planning session — and a look at the ‘three horizons’ model for future thinking.

The second virtual round table will take place on 27 May: **how can we do radical rebuilding?**  
This will look at application of the ‘five worlds model’ and ‘five key leadership practices’ applied not to organisations, but to creating place-based, emergent, learning systems.

Further dates to be planned. A core group will meet on the ‘off weeks’ to plan and input, and materials from each session will be shared with all participants. The community is supported with free groups on WhatsApp and [groups.io](http://groups.io/)
