<p>A couple of years ago, a fun blockchain experiment called <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/subscribe?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=422260">satoshis.place</a> was launched. It&#8217;s still live, but not very active. Satoshi&#8217;s place is an online graffiti wall powered by bitcoin micropayments. You modify the wall manually or programmatically, and pay in proportion to the number of pixels you modify. And anyone can pay to overwrite your artistry&#8230;</p>
