<p><em><a href="https://vaughntan.org/about">I&#8217;m an author, organizational sociologist, strategy professor, unsuccessful furniture maker, and Xoogler</a>&#8212;this is yet another of my attempts to make sense of the state of not-knowing. My first book, </em><a href="https://vaughntan.org/uncertainty">The Uncertainty Mindset: Innovation Insights from the Frontiers of Food</a><em>, will be available in early June.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null&#x007D;"><a class="button primary" href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>For those lucky enough to not yet be devastated by coronavirus fallout, the current state of lockdown feels deceptively dozey. Now that there&#8217;s almost no variation in my daily routine, small victories become noticeable. For instance, last Thursday I felt smug when I accidentally timed my return from a weekly trip to collect a box of vegetables to just miss a torrential downpour. </p><p>On a recent Zoom call, someone who was a child when the Great Depression started in 1929 told us that these times feel much like those first months did then, when everyone&#8217;s normal way of life began to slowly fall apart. </p><p>I didn&#8217;t need her to tell me that. I&#8217;m deeply unsettled by the uncertainty of the future, and have been for many months now. </p><p>Lockdown is analogous to how some people I know would like to freeze themselves, to be defrosted at some future and more perfect time. But lockdowns and government aid cannot last near long enough for a coronavirus solution in the form of a vaccine or highly effective therapy. We&#8217;ll be forced to unfreeze before technology has solved all, or even most, of the problems to which flesh is heir. </p><p>This means the near future is certainly going to be uncertain, and I&#8217;m not as ready for this as I want to believe. </p><p>My life is fundamentally stable and predictable despite purporting to embrace uncertainty. I go the same farmers market to get vegetables at the same time every week. The bar I liked in London had a menu which changed every week on an evolving annual cycle, and I looked forward on every visit to this year&#8217;s version of the menu at this time last year. My work (for now) is at a university (the ultimate lumbering herbivore of the institutional ecology) where there is an annual and predictable teaching cycle. The list goes on.</p><p>A daily life built around these predictable routines makes a habit out of certainty and predictability. And it isn&#8217;t surprising that becoming habituated to certainty and predictability means becoming distressed when that predictability suddenly goes away.</p><div><hr></div><p>Learning how to be OK&#8212;cognitively and emotionally&#8212;when things fall apart is hard. It also takes practice, like how going for a run every day means being able to dash for the train without your lungs feeling afterward like they have fallen out on the ground.</p><p>Difficult work becomes easier when it starts out unthreateningly small and insignificant, and is so constantly present that it becomes unnoticeable&#8212;when it is ambient. (<a href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/16-working-for-an-uncertain-future">Issue #16</a> was about using this principle to redesign hiring practices to produce more adaptable organizations.) </p><p>Confronting larger-scale, more consequential unpredictability becomes easier if small-scale unpredictability is ubiquitous in daily life. But ambient unrewarded unpredictability is grim and joyless. In fact, it is worse than that. It is a strategy used in torture because it swiftly corrodes identity and personality.</p><p>So a second principle is that ambient uncertainty should be designed to be rewarding. This teaches not only <em>acceptance </em>of uncertainty but also<em> eager anticipation</em> of it. For this to work, the only form of reward that works is unexpected pleasure. The right associations and reinforcements only form when continual exposure to low-level unpredictability results in surprising bursts of delight. Extraordinarily good lemonade can make you look forward to life giving you lemons.</p><p>So here&#8217;s a hypothesis: To be ready for uncertainty, it helps to design routines around two principles&#8212;</p><ol><li><p>Force <strong>continual low-level confrontation with uncertainty</strong>, and </p></li><li><p>Provide exposure to the <strong>serendipity of unexpected desirability</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>Next week, Part 2 dives deeper into ambient uncertainty as a practice for everyday life.
