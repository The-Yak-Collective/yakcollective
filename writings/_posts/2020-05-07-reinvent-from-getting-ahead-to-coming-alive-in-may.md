Greetings friends! I’ve decided to run a small experiment, opening up Reinvent for a short time at three different prices and as a self-paced course. I am offering it for **free, 50# off, and full price.** If you choose free option, I’ll send you a friendly automated email to offer an optional gift only if you complete the the course which [I don’t have any expectations of](https://think-boundless.com/how-the-gift-economy-will-help-us-bridge-the-gap-to-a-better-working-world/). The best thing you could offer is some detailed feedback.

The course will **kick off on May 10th** and then you will receive a series of weekly e-mails outlining the lessons and goals of the week. You’ll also get access to a Notion template to take notes as well as an invite to a Discord group where you can share what you learn along the way.

I’m planning on a light-touch engagement with the group through the discord chat, but I am pretty much always down to jam on work & finding different paths, so I’ll likely engage with people 1 on 1 if they want.
