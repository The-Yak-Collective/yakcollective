<p>Happy birthday to me! I launched my philosophical life coaching practice one year ago.</p><p>Working from home while parenting full-time has been nothing short of brutal these past 8 weeks, and I could use this boost of motivation from surveying my business&#8217;s infancy. </p><p>I also hope there is something potentially educational or illuminating in here for the entrepreneurial among you.</p><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2F3fdedb6e-3d4c-4372-8f4b-fcc091bbc36c_500x737.jpeg"><img style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 737px;" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2F3fdedb6e-3d4c-4372-8f4b-fcc091bbc36c_500x737.jpeg" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fdedb6e-3d4c-4372-8f4b-fcc091bbc36c_500x737.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:737,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;birthday.jpg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007D;" alt="birthday.jpg"></a><p>When I first hung up my shingle, I had tired of opportunistically accepting one incoherent work opportunity after another (I was also 8+ months pregnant&#8230;)</p><p>I wanted to offer something of very specific interest to the world, without watering myself down or feeling forced to accept conventional business advice &amp; practices. <em>(Full disclosure: I also enjoy the benefits of non-primary-breadwinner status in our household).</em></p><p>Naturally, this first year has contained a variety of ups and downs. I&#8217;ve made many mistakes, both substantive coaching mistakes and business-type mistakes. I have lots left to learn. </p><p>But overall, I feel validated in my approach to philosophical life coaching and determined to turn my early successes into self-employment for the long haul. </p><h2>Strategy: The Paid Intro Session</h2><p><strong>From the start, I planned to avoid doing tons and tons of coaching for free.</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m convinced the paid intro call has been critical to my success so far. Why?</p><ul><li><p>I don&#8217;t have the time to do free calls</p></li><li><p>Free calls invite tire-kickers who aren&#8217;t actually willing to spend money</p></li><li><p>A reasonably-priced intro call offers a way for people who can&#8217;t afford ongoing coaching to get a bit unstuck, without either one of you feeling like you&#8217;ve wasted the other&#8217;s time</p></li><li><p>Although a paid intro session deters some prospective clients, it means the ones who show up at my door are very well qualified</p></li></ul><p>My reduced-rate intro session is called the <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/work-with-me">&#8220;False Belief Fix-Up&#8221;</a> ($75 for ~40 minutes). I sell about 2 of these per month. Nearly half of intro rate clients return for at least one full-priced session. </p><p>When new clients buy the intro session, they&#8217;re sent to a Google Form of intro questions. I don&#8217;t think these questions are particularly special, but many remark that just filling out the questionnaire helps them. Great way to get started on the right foot!</p><p>Before the intro session takes place, I read the questionnaire answers and come up with a few followup questions for the client. This makes the intro session really pack a punch despite its &lt;1hr length - the client can see right away what working with me would be like.</p><p>My goal is for every client to leave their intro session with at least one area for introspection/experimentation. So even if we never speak again, I&#8217;ve been useful to them. </p><h2>Email Coaching</h2><p>Email clients pay up front via a checkout that&#8217;s always open, and mostly these have been people who I do not know at all prior to their signup.</p><p>I have some clients doing hybrid phone &amp; email engagements, having come in either via the paid intro call or email. One call per month with email support throughout is a useful option for people who like the personal nature of speaking, but who also want the ongoing accountability &amp; structure that a coach can provide.</p><h2>Paid Newsletter</h2><p>I recently launched <a href="http://pamelajhobart.substack.com/">&#8220;Questions for Smart People&#8221;</a> as a paid tier of subscription on top of my ordinary free emails. I send weekly prompts for thought each Sunday morning. </p><p>I&#8217;m planning to begin weekly &#8220;office hours&#8221; for all paid subscribers soon. Plus the highest tier of paid subscription is like email coaching lite / interactive journaling - if the client sends their reflections on the prompt to me, I&#8217;ll write them back. </p><h2>Marketing</h2><p>I don&#8217;t market much - just some irregular <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog">blogging</a>, aspirationally-weekly <a href="http://pamelajhobart.substack.com/">email newsletters</a> to my small list, and continuous <a href="https://twitter.com/amelapay">tweeting</a> that is far from professional. </p><p>When paid childcare becomes available again, I&#8217;ll ramp up marketing to fill my new capacity. For now, the stream of clients my haphazard marketing produces works great.</p><h2>How About Some Numbers:</h2><p>First year gross revenue:<strong> $13,740</strong></p><p>Operating expenses (credit card processing, Squarespace, domain): ~$500</p><p>Phone &amp; video sessions: <strong>110</strong> (current rate $125/hr, was lower previously)</p><p>Client-months of coaching &amp; convo by email: <strong>32 </strong>(current rate $200/month, was lower previously)</p><p>Paid intro sessions: <strong>22</strong> (at $75 intro price)</p><p>Percent of intro sessions converted into client with at least one full-price session: <strong>45&#x0023;</strong> (10)</p><p>Email list subscribers: <strong>298</strong></p><h2>Year 2</h2><p>I had hoped to systematize my blogging &amp; email newsletters &amp; social media this spring, but that&#8217;s gone to hell. </p><p>The new strategy is just to stay the course! So far, so good. </p><p>Thank you for your readership, patronage, and moral support. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Pamela J. Hobart, The Life Coach for Smart People</p>
