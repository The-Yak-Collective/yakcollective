<p><em>Greetings to readers old and new. This is yet another of&nbsp;<a href="https://vaughntan.org/">Vaughn Tan</a>&#8217;s weekly attempts to make sense of the state of not-knowing. The&nbsp;<a href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/the-uncertainty-mindset">first issue</a> explains the project; you can see all the issues&nbsp;<a href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/">here</a>.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null&#x007D;"><a class="button primary" href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is an early draft of my contribution to a Top Secret new project from <a href="https://www.yakcollective.org/about/">the Yak Collective</a>. I write here for organizations and their leaders &#8230; but similar fear of failure dynamics prevent individuals from transforming their careers.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Making something new and useful means learning how to do something that&#8217;s never been done before. The uncertainty of innovation means failure of some form is all but guaranteed in the course of doing innovation work. </p><p>Real, transformative innovation is difficult for big corporations because their leaders rarely commit to and support the kinds of innovation work that lead to real novelty and utility: work which exposes the corporation to the possibility of real failure.&nbsp;</p><p>Underlying this is one of the many paradoxes of corporate success: as a corporation grows in size, its brand and reputation grow too&#8212;these are assets that are hard to build and easy to destroy. Big corporations are successful, and so have much more to lose from failure than small ones do. </p><p>All leaders know, cognitively, that innovation is important and that failure is a necessary part of innovation&#8212;and everyone fears failure. </p><p>A corporation&#8217;s leaders are responsible for protecting its assets, and the prospect of losing a trove of laboriously acquired, valuable assets intensifies their fear of failure.&nbsp;The bigger the corporation, the more valuable its brand and reputation. The more valuable the brand and reputation the corporation&#8217;s leaders must protect, the more intense and debilitating their fear of failure becomes. </p><p>Fear of failure is one of the key barriers to a big corporation&#8217;s leadership committing the resources of the corporation to the failure-prone pursuit of real, transformative innovations. This is how visceral fear of failure becomes an <em>emotional</em> obstacle to innovation, even when innovation is <em>cognitively</em> well-understood and acknowledged to be essential for survival and growth. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The big corporation innovation problem is rooted not in cognition but in emotion.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p>To see how this plays out concretely, consider the example of a large, established advertising agency&#8212;let us call it X.&nbsp;</p><p>In its early decades of life, X established itself as an industry leader by developing groundbreaking advertising campaigns and innovative strategies for identifying and reaching consumers for its clients. It gradually expanded into every major global market.</p><p>On the strength of its creative team and capacity for developing innovative advertising and marketing strategies, X built a stable and highly lucrative client portfolio of some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies in CPG, automotive, insurance, and other consumer-facing industries.&nbsp;</p><p>However, X now faces a media and advertising market that has been transformed by the growing importance of e-commerce and social media. Smaller digital-first agencies are now highly competitive with X because they understand the constraints and freedoms these new media and advertising markets represent. These digital-first agencies have been able to develop innovative campaigns and marketing strategies that are less expensive to run and more effective than the best strategies X can come up with.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in the last decade, X began first to lose parts of client accounts to smaller, much more nimble, digital-first agencies&#8212;then to lose whole accounts outright. X is increasingly losing its top creative and strategic talent to these upstart agencies too.</p><p>Why can&#8217;t X pivot effectively into digital? It&#8217;s not for lack of trying.&nbsp;</p><p>When I talk to people working at X&#8212;the creatives and strategists on the ground actually developing campaign ideas&#8212;they say that the agency does come up with really innovative digital marketing campaign ideas and pitches. However, these rarely get approved by X&#8217;s leaders to be shown to clients in their undilutedly innovative form. </p><p>This is because X&#8217;s leadership perceive these innovation proposals as being too different from X&#8217;s tested playbook. These truly innovative campaign proposals might work&#8212;but they might also fail.</p><p>X&#8217;s clients expect success from expensive campaigns delivered by an established agency. X has an enormous reputation for success, so X&#8217;s senior leadership have a visceral fear of putting in front of clients campaigns that are innovative but which could fail dramatically.</p><p>Though X&#8217;s leaders tell their teams that innovation is essential to X&#8217;s survival, they cannot resist the urge&#8212;illogical and emotional&#8212;to gradually water down innovative campaign proposals during internal review. What ultimately gets shown to clients is reliable enough but dull.</p><p>As an established big agency, X&#8217;s biggest asset is its reputation for success among its portfolio of premium clients. This has become, paradoxically, a liability. X&#8217;s long-standing reputation creates in its leaders a visceral, debilitating fear of failure&#8212;and this prevents them from committing to the failure-prone work that might deliver transformative innovation to its clients.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>X&#8217;s leaders are like leaders in big corporations everywhere. They <em>know</em> they have to fail to innovate but their deep-seated, emotional fear of failure is irresistible. Against their own will, they water down and give short shrift to real innovation work because it is prone to failure&#8212;though they know it is this work that their businesses need most.</p><div><hr></div><p>It was 28&#176;C a few days ago when I went south of the river. </p><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2F63526252-ae59-406c-9fcb-29a59a17417e_920x1227.jpeg"><img style="max-width: 920px; max-height: 1227px;" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https&#x0023;3A&#x0023;2F&#x0023;2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com&#x0023;2Fpublic&#x0023;2Fimages&#x0023;2F63526252-ae59-406c-9fcb-29a59a17417e_920x1227.jpeg" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63526252-ae59-406c-9fcb-29a59a17417e_920x1227.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1227,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null&#x007D;" alt=""></a><p>clearly, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=RDP3lfpr8do&amp;list=PLXy4K0Fov3l4nLLyoevBPaj3zlUfjF_J-">this town is too hot.</a></p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="&#x007B;&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/30-fear-of-failure?&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null&#x007D;"><a class="button primary" href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/30-fear-of-failure?&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p><em>Find me on the web at&nbsp;</em><a href="https://vaughntan.org/">www.vaughntan.org</a><em>, on Twitter&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/vaughn_tan">@vaughn_tan</a><em>, on Instagram&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vaughn.tan/">@vaughn.tan</a><em>, or by email at &lt;</em><a href="mailto:uncertaintymindset@vaughntan.org">uncertaintymindset@vaughntan.org</a>&gt;. </p>
