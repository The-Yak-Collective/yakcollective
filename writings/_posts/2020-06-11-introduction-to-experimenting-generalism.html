<p>With a substantial indie-life runway of 3 years, I’m confident to claim that I am good at self-learning new things/subjects fast. But there are caveats. I don’t venture into a new domain randomly. Also, both the process of learning and the amount of specific domain expertise I end up acquiring in a learning sprint varies significantly in every case. Still, there is an underlying pattern in this practice that I’ve been wrapping my head around recently. I call this practice of selecting, learning, and applying specific knowledge across different-but-linked domains, <em>Experimenting Generalism</em>. In a series of posts in the coming weeks, I will be articulating what this practice means for me and how I chart the path of an <em>experimenting generalist</em>. This is part-1 of this new series where I introduce the practice.</p>

<p>Repeated attempts to observe and situate the meta attributes of my specific-knowledge stack over the past 6-8 months have revealed a few interesting nuances into the practice of Experimenting Generalism.</p>

<p>First, let’s situate this practice into the broader context of my skill-stack and learning interests.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have top 20 percentile expertise in two domains: data-science and web-branding. I call these domains my <strong>T20P domains</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I probably don’t yet have top 1 percentile domain expertise in any domain that’s in-demand in the market right now. Hence, I don’t yet have a <strong>T1P domain</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have top 50 percentile domain expertise in about a dozen specific domains that are driving technological, business, and social progress in 2020. Few examples of my <strong>T50P domains</strong> are anthropology, storytelling, web development, network science, community building.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can plot my specific-knowledge stack on a domain-expertise spectrum, marked by three thresholds of domain-expertise—T1P, T20P, and T50P.</p>

<p>Almost always, I seriously venture into new domains only when proficiency in that domain is indispensable to my professional client work or when <a href="https://daybrew.substack.com/p/deep-play">Deep Play</a> into that domain is the only way to quench my deep intellectual curiosity.</p>

<p>Here’s the high-level flow of how I level-up my proficiency in the specific-knowledge of a new domain that I just stumbled into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When I come across an interesting/useful topic, I soak myself into it and within a week(or two) of immersion, I have a good-enough amount of knowledge of that specific domain to be able to participate in a conversation with the domain experts. Speed-learning is a distinct attribute of this practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting familiar with the domain’s principal concepts and core terminology + getting a taste of the intellectual spot where the real conversation is happening currently makes me intellectually conversant to talk to the domain experts. This expertise level is <em>conversational proficiency</em>, closer to intermediate level than beginner level expertise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This rapid-learning practice has expanded my set of T50P domains to include about a dozen interesting domains in a relatively short period of three years. This recurring practice of rapid acquisition of conversational-proficiency in different-but-linked domains is what I call Experimental Generalism.</p>
