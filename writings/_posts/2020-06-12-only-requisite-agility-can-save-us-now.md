### What the world needs now is \*not\* another management fad. Everyone is looking for the ‘new agile’ — some impressively deep thinking which can be simplified, commoditised, and sold. The smarter sharks in the ocean are preparing the accreditation programmes…

Yet we do need something. We face the ongoing and unpredictable elaboration of the universe, and time and time again, we are forced to revisit our understanding of the fundamental laws of organisation, and realise we have forgotten or mistaken them once again.

There is, as noted, no shortage of people offering to help with this dilemna — ‘when the student’s chequebook is ready, the teacher will appear’. Yet the most effective ways to offer help — for those who offer, contain the seeds of disappointment, in the form of some or all of:

- A panacea: a one-size-fits-all solution to all organisational ills (real _and_ imagined) — the measure being how perfectly you implement
- A dogma: incontrovertible truths which must be accepted wholesale and honoured for eternity — measured by perfectly to continue to honour the truths
- The passionate denunciation of the _old and inadequate_ in favour of the _new and superior_ — measured by your enthusiasm in espousing the rhetoric
- The creation of dependency, an ongoing requirement for further support — the true measure of purpose of these approaches

### What Requisite Agility seeks to do is to create the conditions whereby organisations are able to assess and develop the capacity and capability to survive, thrive, and succeed in terms of the only measures that matter — the experiences, the value they create in the environment, and inside the organisation.

This pulls the focus to the ability of the organisation to sense and make sense of its world, to turn that into action, and to adapt — strategically, operationally, and even internally.

_Scan change / make sense / decide on action / implement — balanced across operational and strategic levels_

What we are doing is avowedly trans-disciplinary.

- Instead of one fix approach, it’s about fit of intervention and development to context, need, and purpose
- Instead of a gospel, it’s about active, multi-level learning and reflection
- Instead of condemnation of the past and the other approaches and elevation of the new above all others, it’s about learning and using what works
- And instead of dependency, it’s about creating capability

### Join us from 18 June to 10 July — and we will learn to explore new realities and, together, create **the _days after_** the crisis.
