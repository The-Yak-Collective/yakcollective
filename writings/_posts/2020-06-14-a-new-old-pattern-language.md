Many of you are likely already familiar with Christopher Alexander’s _A Pattern Language,_ a holistic design system adapted to life before Covid-19.

For those of you who aren’t, Christopher Alexander is an architect, mathematician, and design thinker whose work has revolutionized not only traditional architecture, but also software engineering and UX design. I was first introduced to his work through writer [Sarah Perry](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/author/sarahperry/), whose work I deeply admire and frequently reference.

_A Pattern Language_ has allowed people of various disciplines to apply design heuristics that are carefully built around the ways in which people actually live, move through space, or interact with the world. It was written pre-Covid, and as such, there is an emphasis on the socially-intimate village of, at times, 7000 people. This was appropriate then but serious foundational changes have to be considered now; for example, a newfound cultural memory of pandemic-mayhem and impulses for/against social-distancing are rapidly transforming how people live.

By adapting Alexander’s existing scheme to the new challenges of a post-Covid world, we can build _A New Old Pattern Language._ Utilizing a first-principles-driven, uniform language will allow multiple agents and coalitions to rapidly scale their [rebuilds](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/dont-waste-the-covid19-reboot) in self-consistent ways.

#### **What considerations have to be taken?** 

Much of the success of _A Pattern Language_ can be attributed to how adaptable it is. Its patterns don’t describe floor-plans written in stone. There is no recommended sequence to the patterns, or even in the manner in which the book is read. Instead, readers can peruse the book at will and pick-and-choose which patterns are most suitable to their projects.

And I wouldn’t say that _A Pattern Language_ provides a modular philosophy of construction. Because there are no hard-coded plans or instructions, implementation is really at the hands of the reader. _A Pattern Language_ provides some guidelines but mostly illuminates what human needs motivate which interactions in space (and gives a sense of how patterns interact and borrow from one another to create a holistic system of living.)

But things _are_ different now. _A Pattern Language_ presumes that work takes place in a traditional office. It argues the case against the nuclear family, indicating a near ideological suggestion against atomization and instead towards communal living. Even though patterns of living from the past, such as living with extended family and generations, may be better adapted for human needs than the current ways of the world, perhaps not all of them fit the rapidly evolving needs of people _now_.

Here are just a few considerations I think must be accounted for:

1. **Radical uncertainty in the real estate market and in geographic distribution of people.** 

2. **Remote-first work: merging of office & domestic spaces.** 

3. **Greater domestic social exposure among cohabitants vs. Deprivation of social nutrients typically transmitted through public interaction.** 

4. **Decreased trust in existing structures → Increased impulse for self-sufficiency **

* * *

#### **The New Old Home**

All the aforementioned considerations motivate the development of _The New Old Home_.

> “… as work returns to the home in the form of remote work opportunities (a trend now dramatically accelerated by pandemic circumstances), we can turn to historical modes of integrated living, reconsidered in light of newer technology, to guide our attempts at co-located life and work.” (_[The New Old Home.](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home)_)

Covid-19 has shifted our collective reliance on Big Food, gym studios, childcare, and other services. It is safer and more effective to provide for these services ourselves. We are relocating many of these functions back home.

### _ **The New Old Home** _ **now serves as some combination of home, office, gym, cafe, school, farm, warehouse and workshop alike.**

This itself is not unprecedented in history. For instance, homes used to be the primary place for childcare. Only when more women entered the workforce did daycare really take off.

The diagram above (by Pamela Hobart) relates _The New Old Home_ to _The Farm Home_, ther old way to be productive in the same physical space for dwelling. The differences largely pertain to the nature of our work; we are now largely remote workers, “knowledge workers,” using tools like laptops, phones, Zoom calls, ring lights, TikTok, and VR. Even when gardening, perhaps we use apps and gadgets for help.

#### **Attempts to solve these challenges are already popping up!** 

People are of course already reacting to these unprecedented circumstances. _The Zen Pod_ and _HAVEN_ are two responses to novel housing demands. Whether these solutions are comprehensive remains to be seen.

_ **The Zen Work Pod** _ **by Autonomous**

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d559358-2b40-4022-87b2-72b78bd8673a_1600x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d559358-2b40-4022-87b2-72b78bd8673a_1600x900.png)

_The Zen Work Pod_ is an addendum to one’s single-family home. Autonomous markets it as a great fit for creatives, perhaps in line with its transparent design allowing an uninterrupted view of one’s external surroundings. It comes outfitted with office furniture and Autonomous offers to install it all for you, including hooking it up to electricity or other utilities (A/C or heating). Its price currently ranges from $5,400 to $13,400 USD, taking after a Kickstarter “early adopter” model. Every _Zen Work Pod_ looks the same as a modular add-on.

I would venture to say that _The Zen Work Pod_ is a rather atomized solution to the decentralized office problem; it requires you to already own your own property and outfits an office only fit for one person in a rather insulated yet antisocial way. (I’m pretty sure the assumption is you live in the hills of Montana or New Hampshire, where the view outside your windows is vast and open, not of your neighbor’s backyard BBQ party.) It doesn’t seem to integrate with much else, but does afford a physical boundary between work and home spaces. On the other hand, one could argue that work is more celebrated as analogous to living as ever; by having two physically separate structures parallel to one another, one for living and one for work, [work takes on a magnitude of value akin to living itself](https://www.sloww.co/total-work/).

HAVEN takes on a radically different approach, albeit more ambitious. A project by The Jetters, Haven promises to “evacuate” people to a collective village safe from Covid-19 and its consequences. Haven markets itself as a “sanctuary” and a place “where the past is the future.” This itself mirrors the philosophy behinds _The New Old Home_. While there isn’t extensive information on Haven found on their website, they pride themselves on hosting a ER Physician:

> _"Social distancing and sheltering in place are essential tools now to fight the coronavirus pandemic, but take a toll on our psyche and will be difficult to sustain for months on end. But if a community of individuals take precautions to be lower risk of coronavirus shelters at a remote location together, while sealing themselves off from exposure to the pandemic, they may find themselves healthier both emotionally and physically."_
> 
> - Allon Amitai, ER Physician & Telemedecine Medical Director at Haven

Haven is a condensed solution, not an atomized one. It borrows from the resources and collaboration of its inhabitants to provide an environment whose sum is greater than its parts. Though Haven describes its projects as “villages,” details on their governance are yet to be disclosed, though it would seem that their villages are already a testament to global movement towards decentralization. Food and medical supplies are managed and supplied internally. Could Haven, whose model is supposed to be “capital efficient,” help pioneer a new, profitable direction for real estate?

Christopher Alexander’s works advocate for similar structures to Haven, typically small villages of families including both immediate and distant relatives. What’s interesting is that Haven illuminates a possibility that notions of family, the OG “ingroup,” may be changing. Instead of cohabitting in a village with people biologically related to you, you cohabitate with those people who share similar economic, ideological, and subcultural identifiers. Communication through the internet has made it easier than ever to replace traditional social structures with subcultural ones.

#### **A New Old Pattern Language** 

These examples above are among the first attempts to help fill the new demands of homes. It remains to be seen whether everyone can adapt to village style living or if people will prefer patterns of atomization. A _New Old Pattern Language_ can help accelerate the development and experimentation of and with such solutions by developing an interactive taxonomy of up-to-date patterns that can be applicable across scales. A _New Old Pattern Language_ could look something like this:

- **Pattern 16: Farcaster Mansion ([Venkatesh Rao,](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home)**_**[Slides 7-9](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home))**_

- **Pattern 79: Harvey’s Photo Studio ﻿**

- **Pattern 146: Portals**

- **Pattern 147: Astronaut’s Airlock** 

* * *

These sample patterns are only a first-pass attempt at what _A New Old Pattern Language_ may look like, largely inspired by the work of [The New Old Home](https://www.yakcollective.org/projects/the-new-old-home) project. Though the value and impact of “high-tech” powered devices like smartphones and tablets is still very-much contested today, one thing is for sure: the tech is here to stay. Covid-19 has locked down a cultural embrace for remote-first work, schooling, grocery shopping and all the tools that have made this possible.

It’s time to find and embrace harmonious patterns of living that let us thrive not only alongside, but integrated with, technology.
