<p>Hi readers, </p><p>Thank you to my new subscribers. I hope you all enjoyed my recent post, <a href="https://shreeda.substack.com/p/a-new-old-pattern-language">A New Old Pattern Language</a>, written in collaboration with <a href="http://www.yakcollective.org/">The Yak Collective</a>. I have another post cooking in the oven; this time on Internet Writer Workflows. It&#8217;s taking a bit longer than expected, but that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s so much data for me sift through! </p><p>Anyway, I finally pulled the lever enabling &#8220;paid&#8221; membership to this newsletter. Don&#8217;t worry, though! </p><h2><strong>At this time, most (if not all!) of my content will still be accessible for free.</strong> </h2><p><em>Consider subscribing at the paid tier in order to show support.</em>  <strong>I am trying to operate at the &#8220;gift economy&#8221; level, where you only Pay-If-You-Want.</strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://shreeda.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=e4698c0a&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 10&#x0023; off for 1 year&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null&#x007d;"><a class="button primary" href="https://shreeda.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=e4698c0a"><span>Get 10% off for 1 year</span></a></p><p>This is also a good opportunity for me to share that I am doing <strong><a href="https://calendly.com/shreeda">30 Minute FREE &#8220;Curiosity Conversations&#8221; with almost anyone who would be interested</a>. </strong></p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/freeshreeda/status/1271121662294056963?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Will also announce that I am doing 30-minute free \&quot;curiosity\&quot; conversations with anyone that I already know from Twitter. <a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://calendly.com/shreeda\&quot;>calendly.com/shreeda</a> \n\nThese are agenda-free opportunities to connect and meet as we are.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;freeshreeda&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Shreeda Segan&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Jun 11 16:46:35 +0000 2020&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:0,&quot;like_count&quot;:3,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://calendly.com/shreeda&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75e0c230-3718-47dd-b2ac-ba17d1dcf42f_480x250.jpeg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Shreeda&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;* Welcome to my scheduling page. * * @sadmoonanalog, @freeshreeda, @cognitivesrpls * * shreedasegan.com * https://shreeda.substack.com/ * https://tinyletter.com/shreeda/&#8230;&quot;,&quot;domain&quot;:&quot;calendly.com&quot;}}"><a href="https://twitter.com/freeshreeda/status/1271121662294056963?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/freeshreeda.jpg"><span class="tweet-author-name">Shreeda Segan </span><span class="tweet-author">@freeshreeda</span></div>Will also announce that I am doing 30-minute free "curiosity" conversations with anyone that I already know from Twitter. <a class="tweet-url" href="https://calendly.com/shreeda" target="_blank">calendly.com/shreeda</a>
