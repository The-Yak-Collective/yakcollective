Hi readers,

Thank you to my new subscribers. I hope you all enjoyed my recent post, [A New Old Pattern Language](https://shreeda.substack.com/p/a-new-old-pattern-language), written in collaboration with [The Yak Collective](http://www.yakcollective.org/). I have another post cooking in the oven; this time on Internet Writer Workflows. It’s taking a bit longer than expected, but that’s because there’s so much data for me sift through!

Anyway, I finally pulled the lever enabling “paid” membership to this newsletter. Don’t worry, though!

## **At this time, most (if not all!) of my content will still be accessible for free.** 

_Consider subscribing at the paid tier in order to show support._ **I am trying to operate at the “gift economy” level, where you only Pay-If-You-Want.**

[Get 10% off for 1 year](https://shreeda.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=e4698c0a)

This is also a good opportunity for me to share that I am doing **[30 Minute FREE “Curiosity Conversations” with almost anyone who would be interested](https://calendly.com/shreeda).**

Will also announce that I am doing 30-minute free "curiosity" conversations with anyone that I already know from Twitter. [calendly.com/shreeda](https://calendly.com/shreeda) These are agenda-free opportunities to connect and meet as we are.

And, of course, if I can help you or your creative and/or entrepreneurial endeavors in any way, please don’t hesitate to [drop a line](mailto:shreedashreeda@gmail.com). I have a [new personal website](https://www.shreedasegan.com/) up and running (finally!)

Sorry guys, I don’t like inserting myself into inboxes unprompted. But it was only fair for you to be notified of these _minor_ changes.

Gratefully,

Shreeda.
