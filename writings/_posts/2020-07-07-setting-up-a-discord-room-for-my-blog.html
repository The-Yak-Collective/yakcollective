<p>I’m interested in new ways of creating conversation and discussion online. <a href="https://quotebacks.net/">Quotebacks</a> is a kind of attempt at encouraging cross-blog conversation. But in reality if we think of this blog as my “home” on the web - then conversation happens in a variety of spaces, but mostly on twitter.</p>
