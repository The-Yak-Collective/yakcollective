A special episode, an audio roundup/summary of the last year’s podcasts. I cover the 19 episodes I did starting in June last year. A year of thinking out loud.

1. The inaugural episode riffing on the like-new ethos of the industrial age and the transience/aging based ethos of the digital age. June 21, 2019: [A Wabi-Sabi Technological Age](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/a-wabi-sabi-technology-age). 

2. On the problem of how to repeatedly break into technology scenes. July 5, 2019: [Following the Scenius](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/following-the-scenius). 

3. Plotting vs. pantsing, and setting the stage for creative, generative work vs. planning to finish something. July 26, 2019: [Planning to Start, Planning to Finish](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/planning-to-start-planning-to-finish). 

4. An episode on how marketing is now a bottom-up process with 3 layers: memes, brands, and missions. August 2, 2019: [Memes, Brands, and Missions](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/memes-brands-and-missions).

5. On why social media favors positive behaviors such as clicking like buttons, but not negative ones like mute and block. August 23, 2019: [Towards Subtractive Social Media](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/towards-subtractive-social-media). 

6. Investing in the things that make you ordinary rather than special, such as being an early adopter. August 30, 2019: [Investing in Your Ordinary Powers](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/investing-in-your-ordinary-powers). 

7. Probably my favorite thread of the first year, building an analogy between charismatic megafauna and technologies, built around a 2x2 of non-marquee vs. marquee, and smoke-and-mirrors vs. WYSIWYG. September 6, 2019: [Technological Charisma](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/technological-charisma). 

8. Riffing on the problem of how injecting AI into a system breaks learning curves for humans. September 20, 2019: [Like Riding an AI Bicycle](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/like-riding-an-ai-bicycle). 

9. Next up, another episode based on a 2x2, this one has normal versus weird on the x axis, and timid vs. bold on the y axis. September 27, 2019: [The Direction of Maximal Derangement](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-direction-of-maximal-derangement). 

10. Picking up the thread on charismatic technologies from September 6, an episode about an idea to replace the concept of Net Neutrality, based on the end-to-end principle, with one based on end-to-end encryption. October 4, 2019: [Charisma Neutrality](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/charisma-neutrality). 

11. A reflection on the death of Alexey Leonov and the first spacewalk with two women, Christina Koch and Jessica Meir. October 18, 2019: [Spacewalks and the Species](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/spacewalks-and-the-species).

12. Putting together ideas from Alan Kay, William Gibson to think about how December 6, 2019: [Inventing Time](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/inventing-time)

13. Navigating time in ways that go beyond optimism and pessimism. February 21: [Beyond Optimism and Pessimism](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/beyond-optimism-and-pessimism)

14. The first pandemic episode. The word default has two meanings: failure to fulfill an obligation, and a preselected option. Both meanings became very salient with the pandemic. April 3, 2020: [Defaults and Defaults](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/defaults-and-defaults).

15. A riff on Marc Andreessen’s _Time to Build_ essay which was doing the rounds then, based on a graphic I made up called the Builder’s Cone, comparing the relative rates at which you adapt versus society adapts. April 24, 2020. [How, What, and Where to Build](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/how-what-and-where-to-build)

16. One of the things I’ve been doing with the pandemic is reading a lot of history that seems relevant. Through most of May and June, I was reading Barbara Tuchman’s _A Distant Mirror._ An episode inspired by that. May 8, 2020: [The Medieval Future of Management](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-medieval-future-of-management).

17. In May, we had the BLM protests and that seemed to bump the pandemic from the headlines. What was the significance of that? May 29, 2020. [From Story to Setting](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/from-story-to-setting)

18. Connecting the idea of big moods to emotional common knowledge, and a complementary concept I made up called little moods. June 19, 2020. [Big Moods, Little Moods](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/big-moods-little-moods).

19. Probably my most popular episode from the last year, a detailed look at the concepts of elites and elitism, how elites fail, and how to get better elites. July 10, [The Next Experiments in Elitism](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-next-experiments-in-elitism).
