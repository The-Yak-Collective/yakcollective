<p>I read a self-help book about performing well under pressure. The following is a blunt reinterpretation of the material to record what I think might be helpful in the present moment. I alone am the intended audience.</p>



<p>Work less, if you can. But if you can&#8217;t&#8230;</p>



<h2>The Heuristics</h2>



<ol><li>&#8220;The challenge is __________. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to do.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;__________ isn&#8217;t my only chance. There will be more in the future.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t actually <em>have</em> to __________. It&#8217;s really all optional.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;The original mission was __________. That&#8217;s my focus.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Things that can go wrong: __________. My plan for each: __________.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Even if it all goes wrong, I can live up to my values by __________.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done work I&#8217;m proud of before, including __________.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Things that can go right: __________. My plan for each: __________.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Only __________ matters in the present moment. I will focus on that.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;The only things I can control in this situation are __________.&#8221;</li></ol>



<h2>Heuristic 1: Reframe as a challenge.</h2>



<p>&#8220;Positivity is bullshit, but I <em>will</em> feel better if I <em>act</em> as if the task at hand is a challenge. So, fine. The challenge is __________.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 2: Not the last chance.</h2>



<p>&#8220;No matter what it is that I&#8217;m working on, this probably isn&#8217;t the only chance I&#8217;ll get to do something <em>like</em> it. There will be more chances for me to succeed. It may not be <em>this</em> chance, but there <em>will</em> be more.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 3: Everything is optional.</h2>



<p>&#8220;Nobody can make me do anything. There might be consequences, of course, but other people&#8217;s priorities are <em>theirs</em>, not <em>mine</em>. The importance of any particular task <em>to me </em>is then only a function of how important <em>I</em> decide it is.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 4: Focus on the mission.</h2>



<p>&#8220;Worrying about the outcome won&#8217;t help. The mission I am here to do is __________. I can only do the best I can with what I have towards that intent.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 5: Rehearse the bad.</h2>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t know everything up-front, but I can take some decent guesses about ways this can go wrong or get worse. I can list these ways out and rehearse in my mind what I&#8217;ll do for each one.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 6: I am not the outcome.</h2>



<p>&#8220;My identity is not defined by whatever ends up happening. My values are __________, __________, and __________.  Even if everything goes wrong, I can still choose to live up to them.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 7: Review past success.</h2>



<p>&#8220;I forget that I&#8217;m capable, that I&#8217;ve done things I&#8217;m proud of, and that I <em>do</em> have expertise. To remember, I can review the <em>evidence</em> of my past work.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 8: Rehearse the good.</h2>



<p>&#8220;Things <em>could </em>go well, in a couple ways. I can rehearse in my mind what I&#8217;ll do in each case, so I stay aware of the upside and ready for opportunities.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 9: Deal with <em>now</em>.</h2>



<p>&#8220;The situation is already in motion, and I am <em>in it</em>. All that matters is what I can do <em>right now</em> to make it better or make it worse. The present moment demands I care only about __________.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Heuristic 10: Control what you can.</h2>



<p>&#8220;There are so many things I cannot control, but there are a surprising number of things that I <em>can</em>. I can and will exert complete control over __________, __________, and __________.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>These heuristics are largely based on the book <em>Performing Under Pressure: The Science of Doing Your Best When It Matters Most</em> (<a href="https://amzn.to/3hCIPRc">affiliate link</a>). I won&#8217;t go as far as to say that it&#8217;s a good book, but I do appear to have gotten something out of it.</p>



<p>A few other influences were present for me as I wrote this post.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cyetain">Jabe Bloom</a> taught me about present thinking and &#8220;the event&#8221; concept. I am grateful to him for helping me play with both of these ideas:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish">John Cutler</a> taught me to use the fill-in-the-blank structure for thinking about the very real conversations we have with others and with ourselves. Structuring ideas in terms of conversations brings us closer to actually <em>acting</em> in those ways. It&#8217;s completely changed the way I think, and for that I&#8217;m also grateful.</p>



<p>Finally, a critical concept present to me while writing this post is conditions-consequences thinking, from Derek M.C. Yuen&#8217;s <em>Deciphering Sun Tzu: How to Read the Art of War</em> (<a href="https://amzn.to/301JmGx">affiliate link</a>). My good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tasshinfogleman">Tasshin</a> has written about it in <a href="https://tasshin.com/blog/means-ends-conditions-consequences-and-the-game-of-risk/"><em>Means-Ends, Conditions-Consequences, and the Game of Risk</em></a>. The conditions in play always present an abundance of opportunity, no matter how little control we think we have.</p>
