I think these books were written around the same time so they repeat some of the same examples and anecdotes.  Overall very good. Not much I hadn&#8217;t heard before but presented very clearly. You could almost use as a primer on critical thinking. I&#8217;ll work on a review. </p><p><strong>Books I&#8217;m Still Reading:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diminished-Democracy-Membership-Management-Distinguished/dp/0806136278">Diminished Democracy: From Membership to Management in American Civic Life</a> by Theda Skocpol (This is quite dull so far but it came highly recommended, so I will continue)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-Equality-Reparations-Americans-Twenty-First/dp/1469654970">From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century</a> by William A.
