Links:

- [How the elderly lose their rights](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/how-the-elderly-lose-their-rights) (The New Yorker): Crazy! 

- [On building a cabin in the woods](https://www.outsideonline.com/2415766/friends-diy-cabin-build-washington)(Outside Online): So millennial it almost seems like satire, but I still liked it.

- [On a different kind of building](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/06/on-cultures-that-build.html) (Scholar’s Stage): A response to [Marc Andreesen’s essay](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) on some of America’s cultural impediments to actually building new things.

- [Dear Google Cloud: You’re deprecation policy is killing you](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc) (Medium): I read things like this and realize I just have very little understanding of how organizations like Google operate and what they're doing that is so impressive.

- [Speculative fiction for people who don’t like speculative fiction](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/03/asches-to-asches/) (SlateStarCodex): Funny.

- [Another one](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/) (SlateStarCodex): Funnier.

- [The Educational Benefits of Obscurity: Pedagogical Esotericism](https://econjwatch.org/articles/the-educational-benefits-of-obscurity-pedagogical-esotericism) (Arthur Melzer, book chapter): There’s a trend in writing to present ideas as clearly and unambiguously as possible. Author claims there’s a long history of writers being anything _but_ clear, that they do it on purpose, and that they might have some good reasons for doing so.

Currently Reading:

- [In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life](https://www.amazon.com/Over-Our-Heads-Mental-Demands/dp/0674445880) (Robert Kegan): I sometimes hear people claim that humans have made society too complex and complicated to manage effectively. This book seems to be in that vein, though from the perspective of individual psychology. Interesting so far.

Still working on a review of Thomas Sowell’s [Discrimination and Disparities](https://www.amazon.com/Discrimination-Disparities-Thomas-Sowell/dp/154164560X).
