Or even complicated — so we can simulate, model, and plan. We want this so bad, we’re prepared to break everything that’s living and special about organisations to make it true.</p><p>But organisations are truly complex and unpredictable. There are:</p><p>·no ‘non player characters’, people all have a life of their own</p><p>·no closed-off worlds; everything can be impacted by a bigger system (why we say ‘VUCA’)</p><p>·no guarantees that we can all agree on one version of reality</p><p>We often say ‘the map is not the territory’. The organisational Jedi understands that ‘reality’ is just what pushes back and shows us that our maps are not it.</p><p>The world is fundamentally uncertain — nebulous, impossible to completely pin down. We see patterns in that messiness, and act as is they were real. These patterns are just more or less useful: our world is made up of the patterns we see or agree on.</p><p>So ‘complexity’ is dependent on context, framing, perspective, knowledge, intent.</p><p>The Jedi works to get enough shared agreement about these patterns to help us achieve our intent.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Where have you seen people agree on a reality that turned out to be misleading?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=organisations&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn&#x0023;3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6706817209471254528">#organisations</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6706817209471254528">#society</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=complexity&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6706817209471254528">#complexity</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=43036065e418" width="1" height="1">
