Greetings Readers!

I find myself over-committed on multiple fronts for the next few weeks, so I’m temporarily hitting pause on this newsletter, using the nifty [pause feature](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041618252-Can-I-pause-my-publication-#:~:text=To#20pause%20your%20publication%2C%20go,subscription%20under%20Pause%20subscription%20billing.) that Substack recently rolled out. I expect to be off for about 4-5 weeks.

For paying subscribers, this means billing will be paused until I hit the resume button. Which effectively means the next bill date on your current subscription will be pushed out appropriately. If you have 12 days left on a monthly subscription right now, you’ll still have 12 days left when I resume. If you have 289 days left on an annual subscription, you’ll still have 289 days.

You’ll still have access to the [archives](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) as usual of course, so you can catch up on stuff you might have missed.

See you all again in a few weeks!
