<p class="">If I've learned anything about procrastination from working with clients, it's that <strong>there is no limit to what one might procrastinate on, or for how long.</strong></p><p class="">Most of my clients have sheepishly reported procrastinating on doing things that they actually want to do, things that are trivially easy, things that might have taken just an hour (<em>or just 5 minutes</em>) of deliberate effort. The procrastination can go on for days, weeks, months, and beyond.</p><p class="">But I have good news, too! <strong>The simplest escape hatch for an existing procrastination rut is to set a painfully tiny goal towards finishing (or starting) the task. </strong>For now, think small. Really, really small. </p><p class="">Willpower exists, but it's weaker than we'd like. <strong>If you're expecting your willpower to do the work towards a task that hasn't drawn you in naturally already, then acknowledge the reality of the situation by biting off something it can actually chew.</strong></p><h2>Painfully Tiny Goals: Costs vs. Benefits</h2><p class="">If the goal isn't chunked down <em>horrifyingly</em> much, then it's probably still too big. Its tininess, then, is the cost of the painfully tiny goal - it feels embarrassing even to say out loud. </p><p class="">But the benefit of a painfully tiny goal is that it's actually doable, the only presently &amp; meaningfully-doable option (or you would have been doing it already). Thus, the benefit of a painfully tiny goal - actual action! - is often worth the cringey cost.</p><h2>Examples of Painfully Tiny Goals</h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">a writer (who hasn't actually been writing) sits in front of the word processor for just <strong>15 minutes per day</strong></p></li><li><p class="">a software guy who needs to write a design document commits to producing just <strong>one sentence per da</strong>y</p></li><li><p class="">a smartphone addict defers notification-checking for <strong>1 hour upon waking each day</strong></p></li><li><p class="">a YouTube-browser/Twitterholic reads a dead tree book for <strong>half an hour once per week</strong></p></li></ul><h2>The Catch</h2><p class="">Here's the catch - <strong>if you set a painfully tiny goal and comply with it, you must then give yourself a sincere pat on the back! </strong>No residual self-criticism allowed.</p><p class="">The painfully tiny goal may become bigger in time, and that's part of the point. But <em>for right now</em> <strong>you need to break the cycle of shame, using minimum viable willpower plus a dose of psychological reward.</strong> </p><p class="">If you withhold the reward from yourself, you run the risk of feeling <em>even worse</em> for having tackled the goal rather than continuing to avoid it - the exact opposite of what we want!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><em>Need help choosing and sticking to a painfully tiny goal?
