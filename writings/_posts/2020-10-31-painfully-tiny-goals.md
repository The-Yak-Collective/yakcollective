If I've learned anything about procrastination from working with clients, it's that **there is no limit to what one might procrastinate on, or for how long.**

Most of my clients have sheepishly reported procrastinating on doing things that they actually want to do, things that are trivially easy, things that might have taken just an hour (_or just 5 minutes_) of deliberate effort. The procrastination can go on for days, weeks, months, and beyond.

But I have good news, too! **The simplest escape hatch for an existing procrastination rut is to set a painfully tiny goal towards finishing (or starting) the task.** For now, think small. Really, really small.

Willpower exists, but it's weaker than we'd like. **If you're expecting your willpower to do the work towards a task that hasn't drawn you in naturally already, then acknowledge the reality of the situation by biting off something it can actually chew.**

## Painfully Tiny Goals: Costs vs. Benefits

If the goal isn't chunked down _horrifyingly_ much, then it's probably still too big. Its tininess, then, is the cost of the painfully tiny goal - it feels embarrassing even to say out loud.

But the benefit of a painfully tiny goal is that it's actually doable, the only presently & meaningfully-doable option (or you would have been doing it already). Thus, the benefit of a painfully tiny goal - actual action! - is often worth the cringey cost.

## Examples of Painfully Tiny Goals

- a writer (who hasn't actually been writing) sits in front of the word processor for just **15 minutes per day**

- a software guy who needs to write a design document commits to producing just **one sentence per da** y

- a smartphone addict defers notification-checking for **1 hour upon waking each day**

- a YouTube-browser/Twitterholic reads a dead tree book for **half an hour once per week**

## The Catch

Here's the catch - **if you set a painfully tiny goal and comply with it, you must then give yourself a sincere pat on the back!** No residual self-criticism allowed.

The painfully tiny goal may become bigger in time, and that's part of the point. But _for right now_ **you need to break the cycle of shame, using minimum viable willpower plus a dose of psychological reward.**

If you withhold the reward from yourself, you run the risk of feeling _even worse_ for having tackled the goal rather than continuing to avoid it - the exact opposite of what we want!
