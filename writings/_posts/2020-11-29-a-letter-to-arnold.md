I met Arnold Waldstein in the USV community, we transitioned from online friends to offline friends [in the comments on his blog](http://arnoldwaldstein.com/2014/02/inspiration-is-for-amateurs-the-rest-of-us-just-show-up-and-get-to-work/#comment-1307091198) and I learned of his passing in [Fredâ€™s RSS feed](https://avc.com/2020/11/we-will-miss-you-arnold/).
