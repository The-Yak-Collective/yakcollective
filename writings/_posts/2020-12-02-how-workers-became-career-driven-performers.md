Modern work critics blame Frederick Taylor for the hyper-optimization of the modern workplace. The accepted narrative is that Taylor kicked off a movement that looked at work as something that could be optimized and managed and that his efforts kick-started a 100+ year movement of steadily increasing optimization.

Sounds good but its not true. Today’s hyper-optimized workplace would not exist except for the emergence of a new kind of worker: the career-driven knowledge worker.

Taylor was mostly concerned with the manufacturing world and he truly believed that an embrace of his principles would help not only managers, but production workers.

> “The principal object of management should be to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee.

He wrote in a time in which the kind of work that is common today barely existed. It would take another 30 to 40 years for analytical and measurement techniques to gain widespread adoption in the corporate world and it would not be because it was the best way for the companies to improve.

It was the language of a new kind of worker, the knowledge worker, that was interested in one thing: their own career success.

## **The Groundless Knowledge Worker** Emerges

While the manufacturing workers of Taylor’s time had a strong “class consciousness,” an emerging cohort of “white collar” workers in the 1950s were not sure [who they were](https://amzn.to/3d4Pbaq):

> _White-collar workers rarely knew where they were, whom they should identify with. It was an enduring dilemma, rooted in what might be called a class unconsciousness, that would characterize the world of the office worker until the present day._
> 
> – **Cubed, A Secret History of the Workplace**

Despite attempts throughout the 20th century for labor movements to include these workers, knowledge workers were distinct because of their desire to distance themselves from organized blue-collar workers.  Instead of labor unions, they formed “associations” and increasingly saw themselves as aspiring business people rather than in tension with the owners of capital and leaders of organizations.  

Taylor wanted to close the divide between labor and capital. What made knowledge workers distinct was that they did not see any divide in the first place.

The knowledge worker was focused on managing a career, developing skills and acquiring achievements or as Merriam-Webster now defines it, “pursuit of consecutive progressive achievement.”

People saw themselves not as a part of an organization but as someone with a first-person account of achievements and contributions and over time, that narrative was something that could be (and eventually, needed to be) carried from employer to employer. 

And as the job morphed into a career, the worker shifted from someone merely doing their job to someone that needed to perform. 

### **Continuous Improvement & The “Theatre Of Work”**

Before the 1960’s the idea of a “career path” was not a thing. Workers hoped to merely keep their jobs. Early uses of the term seem to have been aimed at two audiences: men joining the military and women joining the workforce.

Over time, the idea of a promising career path was connected to the end of a college education and over the 2nd half of the 20th century, it would become common knowledge that the whole point of going to college was to land a good job.

William Whyte, writing in _The Organization Man_ in 1956 notes, “The union between the world of organization and the college has been so cemented that today’s seniors can see a continuity between the college and the life thereafter that we never did”

The idea that a young person was to orient around a good career became increasingly popular. It was not until the 1980s, however, that the analytical tools became central to such a career. This is when new “schools” of business thinking like Total Quality Management, Six Sigma and Lean entered the scene.

These programs gave the career-driven person language and initiatives to “proof” they needed and guaranteed that career success and analytical measurement of that success would become inseparable.

Every aspirational leader attached their careers to these programs in the 1980’s, most notably Jack Welch.  In 1989, he gave an interview in which [he detailed](https://hbr.org/1989/09/speed-simplicity-self-confidence-an-interview-with-jack-welch) GE’s newly launched “work out” program:

> _We want 300,000 people with different career objectives, different family aspirations, different financial goals, to share directly in this company’s vision, the information, the decision-making process, and the rewards_

For someone at GE, it was very clear that you would need to get involved in one of these programs if you hoped to progress at the company. By the end of the 1990’s every large company had similar programs and employees had figured out that to get ahead you needed to document your progress.

In today’s working world, the reality of work is that good work does not pay off. You also need to share that success in something consultant Tom Critchlow calls this the “[theatre of work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/)”:

> _Many people aspire to “silent success” at work – to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite – for knowledge work, the performance of the work is the work._

Continuous Improvement programs helped complete the shift of work into a performance and kept workers in a non-stop search for problems that need to be fixed.

## **We Created The Mess**

The point of all of this is to point out that Frederick Taylor is not more to blame for our current business environment than we are.

Many of the challenges that we define as “problems” in our modern economy are downstream from our imagination about what is possible. Instead of blaming people like Frederick Taylor for turning our workplace in an over-optimized world of charts and data, we should be looking at ourselves.

The [myths and stories](https://think-boundless.com/schools-of-work/) that surround our work today are a product of economic incentives, historical circumstances, and the emergence of technology that gave us better ways to track information. They are also a product of a new kind of worker, the knowledge worker, that emerged in the 1950s and was the first worker that oriented primarily around a career instead of place, family, religion, or community.

As we shift into a a new realities for economic growth, career opportunities and demographic shifts, we will need to abandon past ideas of what a [career](https://think-boundless.com/career-trajectory-idea-needs-to-die/) looks like and embrace new ways of thinking about how one should live life.

We look to work more than ever to feel part of something. It is easy to think this is a modern problem, but Whyte was writing about this as early as 1956 in which he writes, “In a world changing so fast, in a world in which he must forever be on the move, the individual desperately needs roots, and The Organization is a logical place to develop them.”

For almost 65 years we have continued to look for a home at work and keep coming up empty. Maybe its time to look elsewhere?
