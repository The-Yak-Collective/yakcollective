<p>One of the reasons why advanced users enjoy <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research">Roam Research</a> so much is metaprogramming—the ability to modify Roam&#8217;s behaviour inside Roam itself, without ever touching its source code. By using JavaScript blocks via the roam/js feature, you can add new customise your experience.</p>



<p>The good news is: you don’t need to be a programmer yourself to enjoy some of the added benefits these little bits of extra code have to offer. Fellow Roam users have generously made many such improvements public. Akin to plugins, you can install these JavaScript “mods” in a few clicks.</p>



<p>To use any of these, create a page called <code>roam/js</code>. Every time you want to install a new JavaScript plugin, create a parent block with the following: <code>&#x007b;{[[roam/js]]&#x007d;}</code> &#8211; this will add an important warning so you are reminded to be careful with any code (especially third-party code) you add to your Roam database.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="227" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roamjs-javascript-warning-roam-research.png" alt="Roam Research: roam/js JavaScript plugins warning" class="wp-image-10462" srcset="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roamjs-javascript-warning-roam-research.png 592w, https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roamjs-javascript-warning-roam-research-300x115.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nested under the warning, add the JavaScript code for the plugin you wish to add. After reading the warning, click on “Yes, I know what I am doing”. Whenever you want to stop using a JavaScript plugin, click on “Stop this” in the corresponding parent block.</p>

<h2>Other plugins</h2>



<p>There are so many plugins out there, you are sure to find what you need. Here are a few more to try out.</p>

<p>There are more JavaScript plugins for Roam being created every week. If you&#8217;re looking up more of them, be aware that they are sometimes called “extensions” or “addons”—I personally prefer to keep these terms for <a href="https://nesslabs.com/browser-extensions-roam-research">browser extensions</a>, but there’s no official name (yet?) for the <code>roam/js</code> snippets users add to customise their experience.</p>



<p>As with everything, don’t overdo it: only install what’s useful to improve your personal workflow, and make sure you trust the developer. The <code>roam/js</code> feature is powerful, and you know what they say about great power. It can sometimes be prudent to try a plugin on a test database before installing it on your main database. Have fun!</p>
