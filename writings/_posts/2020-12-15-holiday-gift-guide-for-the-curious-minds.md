What kind of present can you give to your friend who’s naturally driven by curiosity? For the kind of person who enjoys seeking knowledge and learning new things? This year, not everyone will be able to spend the holiday together, so this gift guide will mainly focus on digital gifts for people who want to expand their mind and add more mindfulness into their lives.

## Online courses gift cards

Unfortunately, most of the biggest online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, and edX do not offer gift cards at the moment. For some of them—such as Coursera—the learner explicitly needs to make the payment themselves. However, there are still a few interesting options if you want to give the gift of learning this holiday season.

- [Masterclass Annual Membership](https://www.masterclass.com/gift). For $180, you can give an annual membership to learn from more than 80 experts around topics as wide-ranging as design, gaming, science, writing, cooking, and more. They also have a 2-for-1 holiday offer, so you may want to grab a membership for yourself.
- [Continuing Education Gift Voucher](https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/gift-vouchers). The Institute of Continuing Education at the University of Cambridge offers many online courses. You don’t need to live in the UK to take them and get access to world-class education for one of the best universities in the world. Courses range from astronomy, creative writing, life coaching, psychology, science communication, finance, forensic science, archaeology, and many more exciting topics. Vouchers range from £20 to £300 ($25 to $400).

## The gift of mindfulness

## Book clubs

Let them know about the concept of the [antilibrary](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary), and treat your friend’s shelf to a book subscription. It’s a great way to support their learning journey.

- [Book of the Month](https://www.bookofthemonth.com/gift). Each month, subscribers can pick one book out of five from the staff picks. You can choose from several subscription options: $49.99 for 3 months, $89.99 for 6 months, or $169.99 for 12 months.

## Learning communities

It’s more fun to learn together. If you are part of a paid learning community, consider inviting your friend. And if you aren’t yet, it may be the opportunity to join together and learn together.

- [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/membership). A community of 1,500+ curious minds discussing mindful productivity, creativity, and mental health, with weekly virtual meetups and workshops. Click [here](https://nesslabs.memberful.com/gift?plan=46201&utm_campaign=roam-research-javascript-plugins&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss) to give a yearly membership.
- [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/). Is your friend interested in building a business in 2021, but doesn’t know how to code? A subscription to a no-code learning community may be the perfect gift.
- [Visualize Value](https://shop.visualizevalue.com/products/membership). A learning community for people who want to generate an income online. Includes a library of templates and weekly Q&A calls.
