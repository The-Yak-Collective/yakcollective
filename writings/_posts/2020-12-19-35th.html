<p class="">Those doctors in Atlanta tried to stop it. Nevertheless, on this day 35 years ago my mother went into labor 2 months prematurely. </p><p class="">I was born at 10:10pm even more wrinkly and helpless than is typical. I spent my first Christmas in an incubator, a measly 5 jaundiced pounds and not yet out of the woods. </p><p class="">Most of you reading this have partial knowledge of the phases that have consumed these past 35 years of mine: being precocious, then underachieving, then finding philosophy, chasing it a while, abandoning it, living SATC, eloping, moving, gestating, moving, mothering, gestating, mothering, grieving, gestating, mothering mothering mothering coaching? </p><p class="">All of that has delivered me to this here cabin, somewhere to the west of Austin, on my birthday staycation. Last year I did the same thing, but in lower Manhattan. My habitual self-transformations maybe should have been put to rest by now, but I've just about pulled it off <em>yet again. </em>Is this healthy? Your guess is as good as mine. </p><p class=""><a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/lockdown-in-nyc-made-me-want-to-kill-myself-so-i-had-to-leave" target="_blank">2020 was easily the worst year of my entire life</a>. At the same time, I can't deny my good fortune, so intense in places. I'm tempted to try to sum up the situation somehow, either to ease into cheery gratitude or indulge in gloomy martyrdom. </p><p class="">But attempted agglomeration doesn’t reveal the truth about an individual life, it obscures it.  Blessings and burdens do not cosmically cancel each other out. Instead, you hold each one, like a stone warm from the sun or a smoldering hot potato from hell, cradled in your hands. Is it all “worth it”?  I don’t know. Does it matter? Not really. </p><p class="">Every day, I think about death. The more I think about it, the less real it seems, like a perversely inverted <em>memento mori.</em> But I'm ready to be middle-aged now. The only thing worse than decaying by the minute is refusing to see it.</p><p class="">I hope I don't die as prematurely as I was born, but eventually I'll die bleeding one way or another. If there is any depth at all to me by now, it's only that which life has carved in.</p><iframe scrolling="no" src="https://pamelajhobart.substack.com/embed" width="480" frameborder="0" data-preserve-html-node="true" height="320"></iframe>
