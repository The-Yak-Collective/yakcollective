<p>I&#8217;ve been a big fan of the energy he&#8217;s brought to his writing over the past couple of years. But he didn&#8217;t set out to have a <a href="https://notboring.substack.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">popular newsletter</a>.  His real plan was to launch an in-person community.  </p>



<p>We chat about how the pandemic helped him figure out why that wasn&#8217;t a good idea and how he&#8217;s thinking about his solopreneur journey,</p>



<p>The reason I asked him on the podcast is to talk about his <a href="https://notboring.substack.com/p/were-never-going-back" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent newsletter on the future of work</a>. &nbsp;He argues that “Employees will ultimately make the decision” about what work looks like post-pandemic. &nbsp;I think he is mostly right and we talk about what that might mean for people&#8217;s lives.</p>



<h2>Quotes</h2>



<p>On his competitive advantage</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My only differentiation&#8230;is that I’m going to be having more fun than most people”</p></blockquote>



<p>On making friends</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What you write about defines who you’re going to spend a lot of time interacting with&#8230;It better be something you’re interested in or those conversations are going to be painful.</p></blockquote>



<p>On how much he likes his new relationship with work:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I can’t imagine having to go back to a job where I have to work for somebody and two go to an office every day.&nbsp; Once you’ve had a taste for the other side it seems like a crazy constriction of optionality.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>On having no goals:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Right now I feel really good not having goals&#8230;there&#8217;s been enough serendipitous things happening that Im comfortable not setting those goals.</p></blockquote>
