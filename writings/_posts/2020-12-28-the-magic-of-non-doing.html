<p>I rolled out of my twin bed and stumbled into the common room. As I started the coffee maker I started thinking about my day and had a feeling of emptiness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had nothing to do.</p>



<p>It was sometime in early September in 2018. I had just moved across the globe to Taipei. I was technically a self-employed freelancer but didn’t have any clients. I was single and had declared to my friends a month earlier that I was going to embrace a life path as a “cool uncle.” I had one friend in town but he had a job and other things to do so he could only be my chaperone so many hours.</p>



<p>A year later I would planning a tiny wedding with my girlfriend, figuring out what to do next with the accidental business I created, discovered writing was something that mattered to me and that I wanted to keep going and had discovered a deeper appreciation for life.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, I’ll answer some of your questions but first I want to talk about non-doing.</p>



<h3>Non-Doing</h3>

<p>To <strong>not </strong>do things can be scary.</p>



<p>Growing up in the US, we are constantly aware of the perception of others and that if we are not doing enough, we might get called lazy.</p>



<p>You always want to avoid being called lazy.</p>



<p>I’m not here to convince you that being lazy is worthwhile but instead to argue that our fears of being perceived as lazy keep us from experiencing a much different feeling which is better explained by a term from another culture, wu-wei or 無為 in Chinese.</p>



<p>In Chinese this literally means inaction or non-doing but does not necessarily mean “doing nothing.” Instead it is about doing the things that come naturally. It is doing the things you are drawn to do rather than things that feel painful to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walking around in Taipei was the first time I experienced this feeling. When I was living in New York or Boston in the previous ten years I might be wandering around the city doing very little but it was always in tension with the predominant culture and script in my head that I should be doing something.</p>



<p>In Taipei, that feeling evaporated. I didn’t yet know the cultural scripts or expectations around me. I was both in a state of not-knowing and non-doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I felt okay.</p>



<p>Picture yourself floating in the middle of an ocean and all you can see is the horizon all around you. You have no idea where you are.</p>



<p>Sounds terrifying right?</p>



<p>Now picture you are not worried about where you are. There is no where to go but deep down you know that you will be okay. This is the feeling I’m talking about.</p>



<p>The best description I’ve seen of this is from the Tao Te Ching, written in China in the 6th Century BC:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped. Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way. It can’t be gained by interfering</p></blockquote>



<p>Nothing to do and nothing left undone.</p>



<h3>Non-Doing In&nbsp;Reality</h3>

<p>When I first experienced this feeling in Taiwan I was not immediately transformed. I was filled with tension, guilt and shame. In my head were voices shouting “you lazy bastard” or “you need to have goals!”</p>



<p>Yet guiding me was a line from from a Rebecca Solnit book, “that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you is usually what you need to find, and finding it is a matter of getting lost.”</p>



<p>So I kept saying yes to this weird feeling of non-doing.</p>



<p>Over time I became more comfortable with the underlying uncertainty of life that we all have to deal with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hardest thing about this is the tension it creates with others. When you default to no or choose not to have goals it can raise alarms.</p>



<p><em>“What do you mean you don’t have any goals?”</em></p>



<p><em>“What do you mean you aren’t focused on making more money.”</em></p>



<p><em>“How could you not want to go out to this restaurant?</em></p>



<p>You can only convince others you are happy and content when you are running the same life scripts.</p>



<h3>The Legible Goals are the Least Interesting</h3>



<p>In my <a href="http://think-boundless.com/writing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">writing</a> I’ve been exploring how non-doing overlaps with our current culture of work. The short answer is that it doesn’t.</p>



<p>Our current work culture and our global economic systems are incentivize almost everyone to orient around the idea that more is better.</p>



<p>This has led to the bizarre scenario where profitable businesses are sometimes called “lifestyle businesses” where “serious” businesses can be losing billions of dollars a year.</p>



<p>In my past work life I was a successful worker in the prestigious world of strategy consulting. To break in and to succeed in this world comes a certain awareness of how to make money and an ability to decode the paths of how to get there.</p>



<p>I know I have this ability and over the last few years I keep choosing the path of non-doing.</p>



<p>In the last month I have become aware of a very clear path to scale one of my courses through bold marketing and putting my energy into a number of growth tactics. I know it will work.</p>



<p>But I also know that I have enough right now and after a few years of embracing that weird feeling of non-doing and becoming comfortable with uncertainty I know that a constant trading of today for tomorrow is just not the life I want to live.</p>



<h3>Non-Doing Is The Space Where Interesting Things Might&nbsp;Happen</h3>

<p>You are probably saying, “yes Paul, this is great, but how the hell did you end up married?!”</p>



<p>Great question.</p>



<p>When I tell the story of meeting my wife I tell people that we met at a time when I was wandering around Taipei and reading books in random parks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I was really doing was embracing a feeling of non-doing and seeing where it took me.</p>



<p>I could whip out a bunch of cliches to summarize this story but I think that would hide the deeper truth that when we create space in our lives the things that matter to us seem to show themselves.</p>



<p>By saying no to the default goals that everyone else expects and accepts I’ve stumbled upon the fact that I love writing. When I write it feels like I am skiing downhill. Its something that fits into the flow of life. Something that matters to me. Very much in the spirit of non-doing.</p>



<p>I feel similarly when I am able to get up on a random day and go explore with my now wife.</p>



<p>Over the last two years we’ve gone on more explorations together and spent more time together than many married couples might see each other in the first five years of their relationship.</p>



<p>I’m a big fan of reading books with advice of people near the end of their life or who have gone through hell and lived to tell the tale.</p>



<p>Almost all of these books seem to have the same advice:</p>



<p><em>Don’t sweat the small stuff. Don’t get caught up in extrinsic goals. Love the people that matter. Don’t put off bold risks. Have fun.</em></p>



<p>Embracing a state of non-doing gave me the clarity to see the things that matter right now and not having to wait until the end of it all.</p>



<p>There’s really nothing cooler than that.</p>
