<p class="">I had high hopes for 2020 - early in the year <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/how-homes-work-a-followup" target="_blank">we moved to a much larger NYC apartment</a>, I was enjoying taking my kids to their preschool and working from the women’s club, I <em>thought </em>we’d almost settled in as a family of 5.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Ha ha, no such luck. Instead we ended up spending 12 weeks on lockdown with no childcare assistance at all. Without any outside world available, the large new apartment became nauseatingly small. <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/lockdown-in-nyc-made-me-want-to-kill-myself-so-i-had-to-leave" target="_blank">Lockdown was sheer hell and I lost my mind</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="">I was all too happy to orchestrate the move to bring our family from Brooklyn to Austin, TX - but that was no small feat. It involved 4 trips back and forth for me, I did most of the packing and unpacking, and I was already physically and emotionally exhausted before the undertaking. Oof.</p><p class="">Though the world is still fucking on fire, we’ve settled into Austin really nicely. We live in a beautiful and affordable rented house, I go to Costco like a normie, I used my earnings to buy a little old Miata and driving it, top down, through the hills is better than therapy. I am here today to report on how 2020 went for me “professionally,” despite it all.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2020: A Few Numbers</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="">I’ve now been in business for about 1.5 years. I did <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/first-annual-report" target="_blank">an annual review on my business’s first anniversary</a>, now switching to annual review based on calendar year (so these first 2 review periods overlapped)&nbsp;</p><p class="">Because I’ve used several different systems to process payments and track client interactions, it’s a bit messy to cobble together. But here are the rough numbers:&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Gross revenue 2020</strong>: $30,400 (doubled from first year)&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Total clients served last year:</strong> ~60</p><p class=""><strong>Email subscribers:</strong> 627 (more than doubled since May 2020!)&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">My tentative goal for the year was to consistently earn $1k/month. To my mind, that level of income is <em>not</em> chump change, it’s clear evidence that you’re doing something right and means that you could probably scale to $5k/month and beyond without insane difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p class="">So I was pretty tickled to realize that I’d blown through my goal by accident, despite nearly half the year being consumed by lockdown/move. Even when I’m fully working (by my standards), I put in only perhaps 15-18 hours/week.&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2><strong>What Worked: Regular Coaching &amp; Coaching by Email&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="">Regular (phone/video) coaching proceeds apace - I still charge for the intro session ($75) and raised my regular rate to $135/hr, and offer a bit of a discount for prepaying for 5 sessions at a time. Since I do little deliberate marketing, my flow of clients is a bit unpredictable, but as a secondary wage earner it’s no big deal.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Although phone/video sessions are the bread and butter of coaching, my <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/interlocutor-as-a-service" target="_blank">coaching by email service</a> (a.k.a. “Interlocutor as a Service”) has continued to do well.</p><p class="">Clients use email coaching in different ways:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">some email with me to stay in touch between live sessions for help in working out minor difficulties/staying on track,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">some clients exclusively purchase email, as a productivity/accountability check in kind of thing,</p></li><li><p class="">some clients enjoy the opportunity for longish-form exchange and prefer it to live sessions</p></li></ul><p class="">The failure mode for coaching by email is when someone <em>thinks </em>they’ll love writing back and forth but it ends up feeling like work (especially a risk when sensitive/difficult topics are at hand). I end up reminding them to respond, but that feels like nagging.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Even in this case, though, the client still gets something out of their month, at least about a live session or two’s worth of reflection/brainstorming/life experimentation.</p><p class="">I plan to continue offering coaching by email indefinitely, though will at some point need to raise the price. If you want to <a href="https://next.waveapps.com/checkouts/94c7911b48324cdfb5edf8b377753d49" target="_blank">try coaching by email now at $200/month</a>, you can keep that rate forever.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Sort of Worked: Teaching / First Info Product</strong></h2><p class="">In November/December, I taught the very first round of my course <a href="https://hyperlink.academy/courses/stop-thinking-in-circles/32" target="_blank">“Stop Thinking in Circles” </a>via some internet buddies who launched an online school type of place, Hyperlink Academy. I hadn’t taught online in almost 10 years since I used to teach college philosophy classes, and that was obviously totally different.&nbsp;</p><p class="">I was glad for the opportunity to begin developing this material that had been floating around in my head for a while - about what to do when you’re stuck thinking in circles, ruminating, or arguing with yourself over something. There were about 10 students enrolled in the 4-week course, I earned around $800 from their fees.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Instead of turning that straightforwardly into a self-paced course, I ended up starting with a condensed <a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/stop-thinking-in-circles-guide" target="_blank">“Stop Thinking in Circles” guide + worksheet</a>. This includes a video walkthrough of how to use them and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAgnDLEpK6E" target="_blank">SALES VIDEO</a>, I’m not used to filming myself so that was kind of a big deal!&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Didn’t Really Work: Paid Newsletter</strong></h2><p class="">In the late spring I tried my hand at a paid newsletter via Substack. At first it was “Journaling for Smart People,” weekly prompts for reflective writing, then it turned into “Questions for Smart People” more like thinking prompts.</p><p class="">It wasn’t my first paid newsletter, I dabbled in writing news for moms a few years back, it was fun and well-received by friends but I never really marketed it because I was uncomfortable being a mommy blogger. I really like the idea of paid newsletter writing (our family’s main income is from <a href="https://diff.substack.com/" target="_blank">my husband’s Substack</a>) but I just <em>don’t </em>like publishing on a schedule or doing the marketing required to make such a thing pay well.</p><p class=""><br>The main problem this time was that my email asking people to be thoughtful and reflective for a moment was mixed in with all the garbage, and there’s no immediate payoff for doing it (in fact reflection is often bittersweet or painful), while there *is* readily-available pain in buying an email that you don’t “use.” Plus I still just don’t like having to market to masses. I am more comfortable working with a small amount of people relatively closely than with many in a broadcasted kind of way.&nbsp;</p><p class="">I <em>do</em> still believe that there is some way to tap the market of people who like my vibe and who want just a bit of philosophy/coaching in their lives, but it’s something else.&nbsp;<br></p><h1><strong>What’s Coming in 2021:&nbsp;</strong></h1><h1><br><strong>1. More asynchronous coaching</strong></h1><p class="">This year, I tried a New Year’s offer - <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/beyond-the-resolutions-chat-day" target="_blank">Beyond the Resolutions</a> - that was basically a semi-asynchronous chat day, walkie talkie style, via Yac app. This is an easy and low-stress way to have a thoughtful conversation, and it’s easier for both the client and me to schedule than live sessions.&nbsp;</p><p class="">You can still sign up for <a href="https://www.pamelajhobart.com/beyond-the-resolutions-chat-day" target="_blank">Beyond the Resolutions</a> through the end of January, after that I’ll turn voice chat into some kind of standing offer.</p><h2><strong>2. Reality Check monthly: mini coaching membership</strong></h2><p class="">I’ll write more about this soon, but one thing I’ve noticed is that, because coaching is sort of expensive and intensive, people wait to sign up until they have a big problem/pain. But, like in physical health care, when it comes to improving your life an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&nbsp;</p><p class="">To make this less-intensive, less-expensive, less-BFD model of coaching work, I’m launching a monthly membership: <a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/reality-check" target="_blank">Reality Check Monthly</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="">You get one 30-minute call with me per month, to keep you on track with respect to the things that matter and to troubleshoot problems (practical, moral, existential…) I’ll send a few notes by email after the call so you can remember what we covered. Month-to-month, cancel anytime.</p><h2><strong>3. ~Info products~</strong></h2><p class="">I just have no interest in developing some big “flagship” $2k course. Instead, I’ll keep experimenting with small products better to serve my readers who’d like some guidance, but who don’t need/want a 1-on-1 working relationship. Stay tuned for these, they’ll all be <a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/" target="_blank">on my Podia storefront page here</a>.<br></p><p class="">Thanks for reading, <a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/" target="_blank">sign up for my emails</a> if you want to learn more about my business and/or read more of my stuff about leading a thoughtful life.&nbsp;</p>
