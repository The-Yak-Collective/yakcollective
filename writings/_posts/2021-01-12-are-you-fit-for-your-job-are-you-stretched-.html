<p>The Force in organisational life creates a crackling, positive energy around organisations where work *fits* the people and *stretches* them — and a crackling negative energy which will create dangerous lightning strikes where this is off.</p><p>Work — roles and tasks — needs to make a space which fits and stretches you in these dimensions:<br>- Expertise and capacity — technical skills<br>- Level of work and thinking — the time and scale and complexity over which your decisions will play out<br>- Your adult development — how you make sense of the world</p><p>…and your current appetite for development, which will vary over time — if the rest of your life is in chaos, you’re recently bereaved, going through divorce, and/or dealing with a mental health challenge, you will be less capable than when everything in your world feels right to take on new and bigger challenges.</p><p>Everyone notices all of these dynamics working, or not. If they feel that reward and position matches this ‘fit’, motivation will be high, and vice versa.</p><p>The wonderful variety of humans at work means the inevitability of many hierarchues of work. The Jedi works with these dynamics of The Force.</p><p>What signs do you pick up when ‘fit and stretch’ isn’t working?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn&#x0023;3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6699205886520500224">#society</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=organisations&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6699205886520500224">#organisations</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=68f65219ffbc" width="1" height="1" alt="">
