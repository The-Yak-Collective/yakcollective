<p>Organisational Jedi Knights have to confront themselves with love</p><p>We’re all subject to the drive to impose our models on the world, and the drive to divide the world into ‘better’ and ‘worse’.</p><p>When the world breaks down our models which allow us to act and understand what happens, the pathological response is to force the world to act in a way which matches our models. Organisational metrics often destroy what they measure, because they’re a mechanism for reward or punishment, or destroy the complexity of the situation to make sense to the centre.</p><p>And each time we make a distinction and call one part ‘better’ and superior to the other, we create the lust to power that drives organisational politics, a way of seeing the world which makes it natural that a few benefit while the others toil. The Dark Side manifests when we are forced into an understanding of the world in ways dictated by others.</p><p>The Jedi shows another way is possible, lights up the ways we are brought to see the world — the Courtly Rituals to see the doctor, or the boss for an annual review. And the affordances offered to us -things we can make use of for our own purposes in life.</p><p>What have your Jedi powers shown you about organisations, or yourself? About the lust to power and control?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=organisations&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn&#x0023;3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6696667153329983488">#organisations</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6696667153329983488">#society</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KVbWvNGr2UD3tSun" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cb94f701dee2" width="1" height="1" alt="">
