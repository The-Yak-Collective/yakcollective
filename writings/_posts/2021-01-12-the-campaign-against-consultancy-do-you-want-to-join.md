### The Campaign Against Consultancy — do you want to join?

Are you fed up of consultants who  
- create dependency and undermine the confidence and capacity   
- sell the same old solution whether it fits the problem or not?  
- are more focused on position in their business than value to the client

Look, I’ll come right out — I’m a consultant.  
A former member of the Worshipful Company of Management Consultants, no less.

I love the combination of analysis, intellectual challenge, the complexities of helping people and organisations to be better, opportunities to perform — and maybe just a tinge of ego.  
And consultants, managed properly, can be invaluable

But I believe that the true job of consultants is to do themselves out of a job.

The work is not just fixing or adapting the organisation or people.

Sustainability — doing the right thing — means passing on the skills for analysis and continual improvement, for understanding and rethinking — making the clients better consultants for themselves than you can be.

I think that might be true of most jobs.

What are you doing — whatever your profession — to do yourself out of a job?
