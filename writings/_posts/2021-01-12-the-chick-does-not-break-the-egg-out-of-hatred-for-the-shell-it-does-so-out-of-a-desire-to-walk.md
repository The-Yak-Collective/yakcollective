### ‘the chick does not break the egg out of hatred for the shell — it does so out of a desire to walk under a wider heaven’

Here’s a little exercise I developed nearly twenty years ago, useful for any kind of change where you have some vision or outcome which resonates.

- Share the vision with the group  
- Ask ‘if we are here in one year, doing the post-mortem, because we failed to make this happen, what barriers or obstacles will we identify as the reasons we failed?’

Everyone writes one barrier or obstacle per post-it note, identifying why the project is going to fail.

Then, you categorise the barriers, together:

- brick walls are immovable things in the world that we can’t change; we have to work around  
- partition walls are solid — we have to have top-level support or team effort to overcome them  
- paper walls \*look\* like walls — but if you test them, an individual can go right through  
- mindset issues require us to rethink and innovate

The exercise helps you identify where real work is required, identify risks, and is a cathartic whingefest which lets people process their expectations of failure — and then get on with succeeding.
