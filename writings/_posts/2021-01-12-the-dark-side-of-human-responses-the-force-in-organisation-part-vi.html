<h3>The Dark Side of human responses — The Force in organisation, part VI</h3><p>Human responses in organisation tend to produce patterns of separation and resentment which destroy partnership.</p><p>It’s natural, instant. And it builds more… more separation,<br>more resentment. Less and less partnership.</p><p>As we begin to work in partnership, with good intentions,<br>something turns up. One party takes on the burden, the other is grateful. As<br>the burdened party takes on more burden, power, responsibility… the other is<br>alienated, ‘done to’, disempowered. Or, increasingly entitled and demanding.</p><p>Worse — we put a third person in the middle, their job:<br>to meet the needs the empowered and disempowered have of each other — to be in<br>the middle.</p><p>These dynamics are real — but we don’t see our instinctive,<br>reflex response making it worse.</p><p>The Force is at work, the easy path to Burdened Tops,<br>Oppressed Bottoms, Stretched and Torn Middles, and Righteously Screwed Customers.</p><p>The Jedi resists this pull, creates the independence of<br>mind to act not reflexively, but in service of the system.</p><p>Do you recognise some of these patterns in your<br>organisation? Uneven distribution of burden, responsibility? What would it mean<br>to act in service of the system?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=organisations&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn&#x0023;3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6691582543411736576">#organisations</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6691582543411736576">#society</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a69ed420f7db" width="1" height="1" alt="">
