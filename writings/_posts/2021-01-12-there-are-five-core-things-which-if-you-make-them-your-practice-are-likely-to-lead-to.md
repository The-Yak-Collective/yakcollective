### There are five core things which, if you make them your practice, are likely to lead to organisational success.

Three basics:

1. honest conversations, discussing the undiscussable of emotions and reasoning — nothing can develop unless there’s a shared effort to get at the truth

2. clarity — no learning is possible, and productivity and   
psychological safety are unlikely, without clarity of roles, tasks, decision-making, and relationships

3. learning — true learning isn’t possible without planning, prediction, and learning and reflective practices

These three create a \*learning system\*

4. Culture shaping, understanding that leaders and systems and emotional responses to them create conditions which generate psychological safety and productivity — or not.

A productive system.

5. Intent — measure customer / citizen / community outcomes — as \*they\* judge them.

A purposeful system.

Culture and achievement of intent are \*self-correcting\* measures — if you measure the actual outcomes of your practices; the experience of employees and customers, and learn what works, you can’t go wrong.

But you have to make them a \*practice\* — daily, built-in, acknowledging your weaknesses.
