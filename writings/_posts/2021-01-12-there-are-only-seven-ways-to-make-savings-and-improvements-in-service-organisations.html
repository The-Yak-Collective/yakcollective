<h3>There are ‘only’ seven ways to make savings and improvements in service organisations</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/1*NZVJr17YMIMCMZNnodXqaw.png" /></figure><p>1. Shape and manage demand: effect behavioural change, reduce failure demand</p><p>2. Create economies of flow: match capacity, capability, contact points to demand</p><p>3. Reduce waste: re-engineer processes or develop a lean whole system</p><p>4. Optimise the use of resources: buildings, IT, vehicles, other assets, people (scheduling, downtime, contracts and management), income generation</p><p>5. Effective organisation: appropriate grouping and sharing of activities and services, organisational structures, role and task clarity</p><p>6. Optimise procurement: procure volume, shape the market, reduce or standardise specification or achieve multiplying effects, share services, social value</p><p>7. Change policy: stop, ration, reduce eligibility, delay, charge, develop policy to better meet organisational purpose, demand and underlying need, outsource, mutualise, use the third and social enterprise sectors</p><p>Do you agree? (We do, now, have an *eighth* way to save and improve — what do you think it is?)</p><p>Which do you think is the biggest opportunity in your organisation?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d8c3198607a9" width="1" height="1" alt="">
