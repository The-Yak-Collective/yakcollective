There are two fundamental outlooks on life:

➊ To regard the Universe as a gigantic machine hurtling through time and space to its final destruction: individuals in it are but tiny organisms with private lives that lead to private deaths: personal power, success and fame are the absolute measures of values; the things to live for.

Individual little entities cannot help being in constant conflict, hastening the approach of their final destruction.

or

➋ To regard the Universe as one composite whole; an organic entity, progressively driving towards greater harmony and unity whose individual parts exist as interdependent aspects of one whole realising their fullest life where communal contentment is the absolute measure of values.

This philosophy strives towards greater social responsibility.

The world is more complex than either/or. But…

So much of business, society, life is the former — some believe this is the only possibility.

What would you most like to learn how to do, to help make the latter view a reality?

My talk is on the developing journey of a complexity / systems / cybernetics person — through disruption, trauma, realignment, chaos and choppy seas… it might get personal, because it \*is\* personal for all of us.

By the way, a little disclaimer — the conference itself is free — over 20 valuable sessions, and the recordings for 48 hours after each session — but if you want to, you can pay for extras (longer term access and transcripts, I think) — and, if you do, having booked for free on my link, I get some of the money :-)
