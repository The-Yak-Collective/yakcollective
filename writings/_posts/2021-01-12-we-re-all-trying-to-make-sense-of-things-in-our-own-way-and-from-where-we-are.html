<h3>We’re all trying to make sense of things — in our own way and from where we are</h3><p>Everyone responds to the incentives, demands, risks, and situations they face — only a tiny bit of this is visible to anyone else.</p><p>That’s why I use the ‘blind men and the elephant’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Tw1LzN75NFeY_xOJ" /></figure><p>My point is *not* that we can ever see ‘the whole of the elephant’ — forget it. <br>Everyone’s world is their own, unique, based on what’s going on in their life and how they make sense of it.</p><p>The front end is sharp, spiky. Dangerous. Being there is a world of pain. Everything you send them looks like more spiky and dangerous stuff.</p><p>The very back of the elephant? The universe is only sending them one message — dung.</p><p>This can help us at three levels</p><p>- emotional literacy: if I don’t know what’s going on in their world, I can enquire, learn, adapt<br>- thinking strategically: ‘If I’m in elephant rider world, trying to work with elephant foot people, that’s not just person-to-person’<br>- thinking about changing the conditions of the different worlds — ‘how can I do what I need to do now, but make it slightly easier for our parts of the world to communicate’</p><p>What’s your best tip for getting into the worlds of other people — understanding what’s really going on for them?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=complexity&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn&#x0023;3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6734737917031399424">#complexity</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6734737917031399424">#society</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=weltanschauung&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6734737917031399424">#weltanschauung</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=organisations&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6734737917031399424">#organisations</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7326f91c13ab" width="1" height="1" alt="">
