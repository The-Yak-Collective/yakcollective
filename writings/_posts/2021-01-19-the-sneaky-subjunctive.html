<p class=""><em>Last week, I noticed a possibly problematic thought pattern several times during client sessions. I’m here today to give it a name and an explanation.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p class=""><em>Whether you’re figuring this out for yourself, or you’re reading this link because you and I met and I sent the link to you, I hope it helps!&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><br>The subjunctive tense is sometimes used to indicate hypotheticality. You can use it to locate various instances of aspirational, if/then thinking in yourself or in others:&nbsp;</p><p class=""><em>If I were really that confident, then I’d quit my job now.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>If I were acting from abundance instead of scarcity, then I’d invest in that course.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>If I were less self-conscious, then I’d wear that dress.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>If I were less socially awkward, then I’d love going to parties.&nbsp;</em></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">When people speak or think like this, in the unreal subjunctive tense, they have one foot in their actual, present-self and one foot out the door into an aspirational future-self. They can see that they’re aiming towards attaining some valuable quality, but that this process has not yet come to fruition.&nbsp;</p><p class="">What’s wrong with thinking like this? Isn’t it good to let your aspirations inform your actions? Isn’t that how we become better?</p><p class="">First, <strong>it’s just not true that we know exactly what you would do if you had more of your desired qualities.</strong> Very often, self-confident people <em>don’t</em> quit their jobs, “abundant” people <em>don’t</em> make one splurge purchase or another, non-self-conscious people decline to wear skimpy clothes, and non-socially-awkward people stay home rather than attending the party. These claims only seem true in the imagination of the aspirational person. They are not true in a robust sense.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Worse, <strong>the sneaky subjunctive invites a premature narrowing of what ought to be a broad, all-things-considered decision about what to do.</strong> If/then thinking based on one discrete trait ignores how, <em>in vivo,</em> our traits recombine and interact in ultra-complicated ways.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Sure, more confidence or abundance or less self-consciousness might <em>suggest </em>that the likelihood of you doing something would go up or down. But this is hardly conclusive - all manner of other traits and values will inform the decision, not to mention external circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The confident person may also be either altruistic or selfish, the less-socially-awkward person could be anywhere from codependent to misanthropic. Are all of these equally as good? <strong>Over-focusing on the target trait obscures how it does or could fit into your personal psychological ecosystem.</strong></p><p class="">Bottom line: </p><p class=""><strong>When you (inaccurately) hold up one course of action as the one that your better self would definitely do, you up the ante in what was <em>already</em> a difficult decision.</strong></p><p class="">It’s like daring yourself to do the (apparent) self-confident/abundant/etc thing. Occasionally, you get dared to do something you want to do already (kiss that cute classmate, eat 6 donuts). But, most of the time, dares cause you to do something <em>you didn’t already have other sufficient reason to do.</em></p><p class="">Now look, I am basically a virtue ethicist and I believe that thinking in terms of character traits is often useful. But that doesn’t mean every trait-based line of thought is without its inaccuracies or potential costs. There’s a big difference between thinking “hm, if I were generous I’d sometimes treat my friends to lunch” and “if I were confident, then I’d do [this particular huge complicated thing right now]”.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>If you (dubiously) assume out of the gate what your better, more virtuous self would do, you’re essentially begging the question that was at issue in the first place. </strong></p><p class="">Don’t take a decision that could have been object-level and make it needlessly fraught. Root out the suspicious, sneaky subjunctive.&nbsp;</p>
