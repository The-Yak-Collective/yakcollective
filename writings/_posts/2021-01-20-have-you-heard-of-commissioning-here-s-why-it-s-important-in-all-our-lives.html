<p><strong>‘Commissioning’ is misunderstood, denigrated, reduced to something else, and important. Often seen as just procurement, outsourcing, or a commercial activity, in fact it is about really achieving our goals as a society.</strong></p><p>There are three versions of commissioning</p><p>1.0 started as a way to try to buy things effectively, thinking about the real needs, and learning from results. Commissioners were the centre of the universe, their budget what made everything happen</p><p>Imagine buying street cleaning services. Complicated, tough — but you sign the contract and things happen</p><p>2.0 got us thinking about the outcomes we need, and how to get to them — immediately making the commissioner a humbler part of a much bigger, complex system</p><p>Now think about how you achieve the goal of clean streets — it’s a much bigger picture</p><p>3.0 means thinking about what people are already doing and achieving for themselves — how can we help our community and businesses to have clean streets?</p><p>In each step, the commissioner gives up their centrality. And gains more power</p><p><strong>Where could </strong>you <strong>play on a bigger stage — and step up from clever buying to outcomes focus to a strengths focus?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qev51qihfbgqjnl/commissioning&#x0023;20is%20an%20approach%20to%20transformation%20%23stateoftransformation%202019.pdf?dl=0">Download the full thinkpiece ‘commissioning is an approach to transformation’</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kwn7kyyYN20pbVg1yhLS7g.jpeg" /></figure><p>#commissioning #publicservice #outcomes</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f34e160f8434" width="1" height="1" alt="">
