<h3>My client ran a housing repairs service</h3><p>Customers could wait a long time for an operative to answer a ‘hotline’. Or visit their Housing Office.</p><p>There were six ‘levels’ of repair; each with a ‘resolution time’ (part of the ‘customer promise’).</p><p>There were hundreds of codes for the different repairs. Customers and officers didn’t understand repairs, so the code was wrong at least half the time.</p><p>Administrators, trying to meet the resolution times, gave out work to operatives, paid by the code, who tried to get the better paid jobs.</p><p>Lots of appointments were wasted because the tenant hadn’t been told or couldn’t stay in, because it had got worse, or because the code was wrong.</p><p>Work had to be inspected in case the operative had changed the code (more appointments)!</p><p>So people called and called again to rebook, complain, make it sound more urgent.</p><p>All the charges, costs, parts had to be reconciled by an army of admin.</p><p>Planned repairs had gone out the back door — but staff rated themselves as the best in the country at responsive repairs.</p><p>The manager’s eyes lit up with understanding.</p><blockquote>“So… if we create this sh*t in the first place, we’ve got to build a great big machine to shovel the sh*t”.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PBzqtEZJatv4a0vj-YmgQQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>What’s the great big sh*t-shovelling machine in your service?</p><p>#service #lean #localgov #housing</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=455ee68eb786" width="1" height="1" alt="">
