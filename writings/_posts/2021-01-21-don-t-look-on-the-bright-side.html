<p class="">Like most fallacies, “thinking in black and white” is easy to describe in its essence - but extremely difficult to apply appropriately and consistently in the medium of one’s life. I’m beginning to think that it underlies a huge diversity of issues. </p><p class="">So I was pleased recently when I came across Kaj Soltara’s “<a href="https://kajsotala.fi/2020/10/things-are-allowed-to-be-good-and-bad-at-the-same-time/" target="_blank">Things are allowed to be good and bad at the same time.</a>” In this, he notices that his brain seems to want to settle things - judgments, choices - in a neat, clean, unipolar way. </p><p class="">Unfortunately, though, this tendency towards black &amp; white thinking doesn’t always serve us well. It buys flimsy simplicity at the steep cost of emotional turmoil, inner bickering, and narrowed metaphorical vision for things as they are. </p><p class="">I’m here to tell you about the provocative, challenging corollary to things being allowed to be both good and bad at the same time: </p><h2><strong>Don’t look on the bright side. </strong></h2><p class="">The problem with black and white thinking isn’t the black per se - it’s the imposed, false dichotomy. “Looking on the bright side” might <em>feel</em> a bit better, if you can make it stick.</p><p class=""><em>(spoiler alert: it often doesn’t stick)</em></p><p class="">Nonetheless, deliberately “looking on the bright side” in effect just reinforces one’s dubious commitment to black &amp; white, all-or-nothing thought. It’s rarely necessary to form a global judgment of anything anyways, so you can afford to experiment with your methods. </p><p class="">Things - choices, situations, people - aren’t flat. They’re round. They have textures. Feel each thing with all the nuance you can muster, and see/enjoy/tolerate the particularity for what it is.</p>
