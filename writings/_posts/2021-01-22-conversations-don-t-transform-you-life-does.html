<p>I throw up in my mouth a little every time I see the claim that coaching will “transform” the client. Talking doesn’t transform people, life does. </p>
<p>Conversation only ever helps when there is enough life there for it to stick to. If you are not out there living - socializing, working, recreating, reading, loving, eating, playing, dreaming - what is there to talk about, anyways? The inferred structure of your theoretical, otherworldly soul? </p>
<p>There <em>is</em> sometimes a bit of a lag there though, a bit of friction - that can be removed. Since your life is finite in length, it may make a <em>huge</em> difference in the end to have learned a few things faster, more clearly - in a way that sticks, in a way that becomes actionable. Very often, we end up needing to re-learn the things we sort of already learned, too.</p>
<p>Sure, “conversation vs. life” is a bit of a false - if useful - dichotomy. <em>(If you object that “conversations are a part of life!” I’ll assume you didn’t even read this far).</em> But, in your gut, you know what I mean. What is “navel gazing” if not inquiry that’s come unmoored? Conversations, <a href="&#x0023;20https://www.pamelajhobart.com/blog/ritualized-conversation">including ritualized conversations</a> (e.g. therapy, coaching), can become too detached from the stuff of life to be useful. </p>
<h1 id="what-s-wrong-with-the-ordinary-coaching-therapy-model">What’s wrong with the ordinary coaching/therapy model</h1>
<p>If ritualized conversations (like coaching &amp; therapy) are not had for their own sake, but for the sake of living better, then the conventional structures around them are all wrong. </p>
<p>Because it’s hard to get set up with a therapist/coach and the sessions are long and expensive, most clients wait until they have an extreme pain point to get going. It inevitably takes a while to develop rapport and build the working relationship.</p>
<p>Then, being money-sensitive, clients discontinue the engagement sooner than may be ideal - more through drifting off than by dramatically quitting. Leaving while gains are still fragile often causes clients to backslide: a typical path to shame, doubt, and guilt over having “wasted money.” </p>
<p>This intensive model results in <em>more</em> cycling in and out of personal problems, some repeatedly, feeling quite unsupported at times - the exact situation that therapy/coaching are supposed to help prevent! </p>
<h1 id="here-s-my-solution-reality-check-monthly"><a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/reality-check">Here’s my solution: Reality Check monthly</a></h1>
<p>Based on the above observations, in 2021 I’m trying out a new way of working with clients called <a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/reality-check">REALITY CHECK MONTHLY</a>. </p>
<p>For $99/month, you get one 30-minute call with me to sort out how last month went, decide what you’ll do this month, complain about/brainstorm about/begin resolving your biggest issue of the moment. I’ll help you keep track of your overall trends month to month - are you making progress towards your goals? What’s getting the short end of the stick? </p>
<p>In my experience, 30 minutes is plenty of time to get into things in a valuable way. Think of it as a kind of 80/20 of coaching: you can reap a large portion of the value quickly: there’s still more to do, but the cost/benefit ratio (in terms of time and money) steeply declines at the margin.</p>
<p>If a Reality Check subscriber ends up wanting to continue a conversation/line of coaching work via email check-ins or an extra call during some month, I’ll offer those at a discount. But there is no expectation or pressure that our work will go beyond the standing monthly half-hour call.</p>
<h1 id="reality-check-predictions">Reality Check predictions</h1>
<p>It’s hard to tell how business experimentations will go - the customer is the ultimate arbiter of what works or not. But I predict that Reality Check will be a flexible, affordable way for me to meet and keep in touch with more clients.  </p>
<p>(I VERY STRONGLY PREFER this to the ordinary coaching route of raising rates through the roof, working with only a few people, and promising them the moon). </p>
<p>Instead of it feeling like a big fuckin deal to start coaching (and then a semi-stressful BFD to end too) we can have a meaningful but minimal level of baseline contact that runs no risk of lapsing into navel-gazing or the beating of dead horses. </p>
<p>You’ll be out there living your life. I’ll be standing by to do just that - help you to “reality check” your productivity plans, your personal and professional choices, the ways you spend your time (or not), the excuses you’re making - are they good or bad?, and so on. </p>
<p>Instead of providing some artificial, expensive <em>retreat</em> from life where we torture theories about your inner workings/upbringing/“limiting beliefs,” etc, we’ll enjoy a bit of targeted conversation that can make your life more vital. </p>
<p>Get unstuck faster, find what works more efficiently, stop ruminating and start moving forward. I can help. </p>
<p><a href="https://pamelajhobart.podia.com/reality-check">Sign up here for Reality Check Monthly</a> ($99 month, cancel anytime) and you’ll immediately get access to the members area in Podia - I’ll post links and questions for thought and God knows what else in there. Soon after, I’ll send you an invitation to schedule your first session. </p>
<p>In any case, thanks for reading and - whatever you do - don’t let someone try to “transform” you for money. Life teaches its own lessons. You probably already have (almost) everything you need, if you pay careful attention. But a little help can help. </p>
