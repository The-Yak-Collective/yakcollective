This is very true, and has generated some quite good comments on LinkedIn (where this blog is 'native', hence the short length - [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6760102139869184000](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6760102139869184000)).

Real, grounded understanding is critical to minimise mistakes either way - and I agree that over-standardising what should be customer intimacy stories is the more likely mistake.
