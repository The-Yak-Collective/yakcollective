<h3>This intriguing image contains two possibilities for organisations, and the people who spend their lives in them</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/709/1*-4aHd-_sPVWKWNEu34Vrmw.png" /></figure><p>This intriguing image contains two possibilities for organisations, and the people who spend their lives in them</p><p>It’s the first modern organisation chart, and here are the stories.</p><p>One story is that this was created after the first fatal railroad accident. They hired an engineer, so he saw the railroad as a big machine. The org chart is to allocate blame — ‘let there be no question as to who was delinquent in his duty’.<br>This shows us why organisations are crushing, miserable jails for the human spirit.</p><p>The other story, though, has you take a look at the chart. Beautiful, isn’t it? It doesn’t *look* like a machine. It looks alive, organic. And it’s ‘upside-down’ — the branches, at the top, are given maximum discretion, consistent with safety and coherence. The board of directors, like a nourishing root ball, get the best overview and information to plan and direct the big picture.<br>This story is of organisation as an enabler, challenger, developer of humanity.</p><p>The bearded man’s name was Daniel McCallum and, to this, day, organisations contain both possibilities. Because both stories are true.</p><p>What do you see, when you look at the first modern org chart?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=320174c60a3b" width="1" height="1" alt="">
