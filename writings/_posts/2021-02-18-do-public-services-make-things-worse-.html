<p>At <a href="http://www.publicservicetransformation.org">The Public Service Transformation Academy</a>, we are big supporters of Good Help.</p><p>This movement and organisation support public services to give help which enables people to be more able to meet their own needs.</p><p>It’s evidence-based, it starts with helping public service employees get engaged with the difference between Good Help and bad help, and it’s practical.</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re pleased to be hosting a webinar with them on the afternoon of 10 March to highlight some brilliant work their network of local authorities has been doing. Don’t miss it. Details below! &lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p><p>The seven characteristics of Good Help are:</p><p>1. adult-to-adult relationships of equal power<br>2. enabling conversations<br>3. tailored help<br>4. scaffolding-support that falls away when you no longer need it<br>5. role modelling and peer support<br>6. opportunity making<br>7. transparency</p><p>What do you think public services need to do to make sure the help, helps?<br>Do you remember a time you got help that *truly* empowered you?</p><p>Here’s the link to the webinar: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/good-help-and-covid-recovery-lessons-from-rochdale-registration-141950001275">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/good-help-and-covid-recovery-lessons-from-rochdale-registration-141950001275</a> And you can find out more about Good Help and join the movement at <a href="https://goodhelp.org.uk/what-is-good-help">https://goodhelp.org.uk/what-is-good-help</a>/</p><p>The seven-minute video clip is me talking about how to move from processing demand to helping people achieve their purposes in life — for me, this is the true work — and the joy!</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https&#x0023;3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqlXaO-7eYyg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqlXaO-7eYyg&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqlXaO-7eYyg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/8591d539efcf925dbabd92764701e9fc/href">https://medium.com/media/8591d539efcf925dbabd92764701e9fc/href</a></iframe><p>You might also like to muse on this classic paper — Services are Bad for People by John McKnight <a href="http://oaklandcommunitybuilders.pbworks.com/f/Services%2520are%2520Bad%2520for%2520People.pdf">http://oaklandcommunitybuilders.pbworks.com/f/Services%2520are%2520Bad%2520for%2520People.pdf</a> — and this webinar on Cormac Russell’s Rekindling Democracy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSRAakkWNT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSRAakkWNT0</a></p><p>Another great network in this space is A Better Way: <a href="http://betterway.network/">http://betterway.network</a>/</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5a2484036e70" width="1" height="1" alt="">
