<p>Warning! Moan Zone (apparently people did want to hear about me personally… 😂)</p><p>Are you absolutely sick of all the New Normals?</p><p>It’s been 12 months, and I *still* know it will be 6 months before we see where the chips are falling and can really put our plans into action.</p><p>I *really* don’t want to go back to the old normal. But I want this one to change!</p><p>Some things have gone well</p><p>✅ delivering our work virtually; Teams still makes my eye twitch, but we can do real, deep work</p><p>✅ business restructuring and pulling together; despite the pain, our attempts at honest, adult-to-adult relationships mean I can say I’ve always tried to do the right thing</p><p>✅ we have survived! Both RedQuadrant and the Public Service Transformation Academy still serve public services, and do it well</p><p>Some things still frustrate 🙇</p><p>❌constant knock-backs, which you get in the best of times in consulting — mega-competition, cancelled procurements, delayed events — all understandable</p><p>❌deep pressure of running operations, bidding, delivery — and a life! Rolling out of bed onto the computer…</p><p>❌continued austerity and frustration for public services</p><p>What inspires you to keep going at this time, what is the brighter future you see?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nathanwpyle/status/1113496650209738754">https://twitter.com/nathanwpyle/status/1113496650209738754</a></p><p>An attempt at a ‘let people get to know the real you, Benjamin’ post — inspired by Athole Forbes who encourages that for a living!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=522f000c58ab" width="1" height="1" alt="">
