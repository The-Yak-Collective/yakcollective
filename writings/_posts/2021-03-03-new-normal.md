Warning! Moan Zone (apparently people did want to hear about me personally… 😂)

Are you absolutely sick of all the New Normals?

It’s been 12 months, and I \*still\* know it will be 6 months before we see where the chips are falling and can really put our plans into action.

I \*really\* don’t want to go back to the old normal. But I want this one to change!

Some things have gone well

✅ delivering our work virtually; Teams still makes my eye twitch, but we can do real, deep work

✅ business restructuring and pulling together; despite the pain, our attempts at honest, adult-to-adult relationships mean I can say I’ve always tried to do the right thing

✅ we have survived! Both RedQuadrant and the Public Service Transformation Academy still serve public services, and do it well

Some things still frustrate 🙇

❌constant knock-backs, which you get in the best of times in consulting — mega-competition, cancelled procurements, delayed events — all understandable

❌deep pressure of running operations, bidding, delivery — and a life! Rolling out of bed onto the computer…

❌continued austerity and frustration for public services

What inspires you to keep going at this time, what is the brighter future you see?

An attempt at a ‘let people get to know the real you, Benjamin’ post — inspired by Athole Forbes who encourages that for a living!
