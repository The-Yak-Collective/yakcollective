<p>It could be the secret to success! There are two great stories…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*aZf4PD6Y5IPufT7CwkHS5g.gif" /></figure><p>In Hawaii, Gregory Bateson saw dolphins being trained to perform circus tricks. When trainers stopped rewarding the same old tricks, what happened?</p><p>The dolphins came up with new tricks of their own.</p><p>At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, scientists rewarded dolphins for cleaning garbage from their pools. And the number of pieces of garbage kept increasing!</p><p>A dolphin called Kelly kept a sheet of paper under a rock, so she could tear off one piece at a time.</p><p>It’s powerful to think of THREE levels of learning:</p><p>1-do our work better (single loop)</p><p>firefighters get better and better at saving people from burning buildings</p><p>2-reframe and rethink (double loop)</p><p>then they realised that it was better to *prevent* fires than save people! And began to work on that</p><p>3-change our identity (triple loop) — the self-image of the firefighter changed from macho hero (they’re still amazing people) to wanting to be great at engaging with people to help them make their houses safer</p><p>Learning can work at *all three levels* — do the thing better, do different things, AND be better…</p><p>Can you think of an example of double or triple loop learning?</p><p>endnotes:</p><p>By the way, I feel dolphins should *never* be kept in captivity. And the descriptions above are simplified for the sake of fitting into LinkedIn’s 1,200 characters.</p><p>The history of this is rich and I love all the intertwingling. Bateson’s ‘deutero-learning’ arose from the ‘double bind’ — a name for the psychological state when you are ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ — and the need to get to a level above that kind of ‘Catch-22’ problem. Argyris and Schon credited Bateson, and both also link back to Ashby’s cybernetic thinking. There’s also a link to Bill Torbert’s Action Inquiry which explicitly operates at these three levels (and Bill is a published cybernetician too).</p><p>Argyris’ classic paper: <a href="http://6-30partners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chris-Argyris-Double-Loop-Learning-in-Organisations.pdf">http://6-30partners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chris-Argyris-Double-Loop-Learning-in-Organisations.pdf</a></p><p>There is a lot more to be said about this — including whether, in such schemas, a ‘third loop’ is ever necessary…</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a2f095cc8381" width="1" height="1" alt="">
