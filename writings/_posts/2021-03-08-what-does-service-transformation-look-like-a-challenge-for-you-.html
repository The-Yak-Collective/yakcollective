I’ll answer any questions in the comments!</strong></p><p>&gt;&gt;The situation:</p><p>&gt; Shepherd’s Bush Advice Centre served the most excluded and vulnerable people in the borough with different types of expert advice.</p><p>&gt; We were open very irregular hours due to staff availability and demand</p><p>&gt; There were loooong waits and limited time appointments for customers. Nothing got fixed in the 20 minutes they got with a random specialist adviser (not matching their need), so files were made and appointments set up with the specialist</p><p>&gt; This caused another load of hassle, as people missed appointments etc</p><p>&gt; People often waited up to four hours to be told we didn’t provide the service they needed</p><p><strong>What would *you* do to make improvements? We made some small ones — then a big leap!</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4a819b58719e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
