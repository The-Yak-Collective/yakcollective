<p>I don’t mean moving up the ladder, I mean how have *you* changed?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gcgGUF0h-aoRw_IJvIV_PQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Miguel Espinosa — under CC2.0 license <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/argosnet/238603786">https://www.flickr.com/photos/argosnet/238603786</a></figcaption></figure><p>I listened back to the first podcast I was ever on, nearly six years ago (link in comments — thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAACD0MBsCxIyl24w2bSrEaEh2SLpcYcUwc">Rob Worth</a>!), and I’ve been through a number of phases:<br> <br> &gt; From a wannabe-class warrior — changing the world from a position of ‘righteousness’ (seems so simplistic now in so many ways)<br> <br> &gt; To an intuitive improver, thrilled to see breakthroughs that made a difference<br> <br> &gt; To a happy toolhead, wanting everyone to pick up the approaches and break through everywhere!<br> <br> I went from having a chip on my shoulder and thinking ‘consultants are evil’, to an enthusiastic corporate citizen trying to play the game.<br> <br> And I went from being a co-founder hoping to ‘change the game’ to… whatever I am now!<br> <br> It’s easy to see *some* of these patterns, looking back — not necessarily easy to see progress.<br> <br> But if I’m charitable, there’s a kind of spiral — revisiting the same passions, but perhaps with a tinge more wisdom. And certainly a lot more acceptance of the deep balances that the world maintains, in spite of all our efforts.<br> <br> Can you see patterns in how you’ve changed over your career? Do you see progression there?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2b55f4a11b61" width="1" height="1" alt="">
