<p>There was a state of affairs in western societies that enabled many to have meaning in their lives through the default path of work. This was not universal, but broad enough and for long enough that the myth took hold.</p>



<p>The basic version of this in the US was the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; and almost anyone who was raised in the US is aware of it.  It involves a suburban community, a decent sized house, father working, mother at home and at least one if not both parents being active in the local community. Trust the path and over time you end up better off than your parents and the proof of success will take the form of material possessions like bigger houses, promotions and raises.</p>

<p>The thing about this path was that it worked so well, and for so long that people stopped thinking about why it worked and just assumed that if you built your life around following the default path, staying employed, and buying a house, that you would be happy.</p>



<p class="has-background has-medium-font-size" style="background-color:#e4e4e4"><strong>Accidental Meaning</strong>: Meaning was an accidental outcome of a path of full-time employment, &#8220;hard work,&#8221; married couples with one partner working, and a house that aligned with a certain way of living that provided meaning for millions of people for a period of 30-50 years.  In today&#8217;s world people are still aiming at these external markers of success in but are coming up empty in terms of meaning.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here&#8217;s the thing: </em></strong>There are a substantial number of people who have achieved some level of visible success who are struggling with lack of meaning but are afraid to share this because one of the taboos of the modern world is that we think you are not supposed to complain if you have money.  </p>



<p>This may be true but I have compassion for these people.  The skills that allow you to succeed on the default path don&#8217;t really have much to do with the skills needed to build a meaningful life.  These people may have the resources to take time off but often these are the people that have the hardest time actually giving themselves permission to do it.</p>



<h2><strong>When Did This Path Stop Working</strong>?</h2>



<p>The short answer? Probably around the year 2000. </p>



<p>The longer answer?  That might take a little explaining so take a look at this chart:</p>

<p>If you were born in the baby boom in the ten years after World War II you had more than a 7 out of 10 chance of earning more money than your parents.  This baby boom coincided with an <a href="https://think-boundless.com/career-trajectory-idea-needs-to-die/">explosive economy</a> and unprecedented opportunity for the baby boomer generation to move rapidly up the growing corporations <a href="https://think-boundless.com/the-boomer-blockade/">without competition</a> from previous generations who retired earlier and were a much smaller generation.  </p>



<p>Anyone aged 45 and below in 2021? You have about a coin flip&#8217;s chance of earning more than your parents.</p>

<p>Now here is where things get tricky and likely why we have not found a good way of dealing with this.</p>



<p>In the chart at the left and you&#8217;ll notice a surprising trend that is that the middle class is shrinking while the lower and upper classes are increasing. </p>



<p>This means that more people than ever have entered the upper tier of the economy.  This should be good right?</p>
</div></div>



<p>The core ethos of the American Dream is a <strong>middle-class dream</strong>. It is not one of excess wealth but one of a stable and fulfilling life build around a vibrant community.  </p>



<p>We now have three different types of economies and the disconnect is leading </p>



<ol><li>People in <a href="https://think-boundless.com/new-economy/">superstar tech companies</a> are building their lives around expensive convenience and trying to distance themselves from the rest of society and finding that they have achieved the traditional American dream <em>on paper, </em>but are having trouble finding meaning in their life</li><li>People in the middle class who either envy the people in the new elite or are happy with the middle class but finding it increasingly hard to make ends meet let alone do better than their parents</li><li>People in the lower class think that they don&#8217;t have a damn chance working in their service economy jobs of ever achieving the American dream and the data backing them up</li></ol>



<p>Shifting economic conditions have nudged people to build more of their life around work. put less focus on local communities and try to spend more time figuring out how to merely match the success of their parents.</p>



<p>As people put more emphasis on finding meaning at work they move away from the things that seem to matter: relationships, community and connection.  </p>

<p>Many of these people are still tied to the idea that if you work hard you&#8217;ll be taken care but are frustrated to find that unless you are working in the tech economy or in an elite city hard work isn&#8217;t all that helpful.</p>



<h2><strong>Accidental meaning doesn&#8217;t work anymore</strong></h2>



<p>We need new scripts for how we think about work.  I&#8217;m not sure what this looks like but hard work and full-time work for the average person no longer delivers the goods.  While <a href="https://think-boundless.com/soul-creator-economy/">new dreams</a> are being hatched in the promise of the creator economy, the results might be even more polarized than the traditional economy.  </p>



<p>Right now you own your own meaning and you&#8217;ll need to take steps to make sure that you are actively designing your life.  This is the advantage anyone who has taken a break or dabbled with self-employment knows.  Everyone is operating in the gig economy carving their own path but the knowledge of this is not widespread.  The 2020s will be the decade we stop believing in the work hard and you&#8217;ll be taken care of script.  </p>



<p>Meaning doesn&#8217;t happen by accident anymore.  It only happens when we figure out what matters.</p>
