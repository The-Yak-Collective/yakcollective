<h3>I thought it was essential — actually, the most important part of my work. But I gave it up and haven’t looked back.</h3><p>I used to work in policy — and we’d produce some brilliant policies. The problem is, nobody really followed them.</p><p>Then, as a consultant, I produced enormous, beautiful slide-decks.</p><p>Full of findings, analysis, recommendations, with graphics professionally tweaked overnight, they were nodded through at Boards and Steering Groups. But not, to be honest, noticeably implemented.</p><p>Then I did business cases and action plans. Felt like people made real decisions. But not much changed.</p><p>So we did Rapid Improvement Events. It was exciting! Stuff got done. Until just when the action plan at the end was completed.</p><p>These days, we do more… work. Yes, we analyse. Yes, we recommend. But mostly, we work alongside people helping them to make change happen in the hear and now.</p><p>We even write it up when helpful. But we’ve learned that the reports don’t make a difference, making a difference does.</p><p>What did you used to think *was* your job, but you can now do without?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=80b87895d8bc" width="1" height="1" alt="">
