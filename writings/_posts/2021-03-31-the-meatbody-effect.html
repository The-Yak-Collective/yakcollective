<p>Sometimes, coaching is a pretty easy job. My clients often follow up their own remarks with more or less what I was already preparing to say in reply to them. At these times, <strong>clients are essentially able to conduct both sides of the conversation for themselves.</strong> </p>
<p>Well, what are they paying me, for then? </p>
<p>I call it <strong>the Meatbody Effect: it’s just plain different to speak to a real meatbody human, as compared to thinking or even speaking to yourself.</strong> With a meatbody human on the receiving end, your brain tends to kick itself into a higher, clearer gear. </p>
<p>In order for the Meatbody Effect to work to its fullest, you have to have some level of respect for the person listening to you. Otherwise, why exert yourself making extra sense? It’s also important not to feel judged or scrutinized, and to feel free to riff on your own thoughts. </p>
<p>The Meatbody Effect only partially applies to organic conversations with friends or acquaintances. Since there are norms against them poking holes in your argument, you may be subconsciously less careful. </p>
<p>You can try to hijack the Meatbody Effect in a solo setting. Some people have good results speaking out loud to themselves or speaking to an imaginary listener, for instance. </p>
<p><strong>But the easiest way to make the Meatbody Effect work for you is simply by recruiting an appropriate meatbody for service.</strong> Cognitive distortions create problems, but this one can also be part of a solution.</p>
<p>Sometimes my philosophical life coaching work is an active, sensitive, nuanced, and thoughtful endeavor. And other times, I’m just the right meatbody for the job. </p>
