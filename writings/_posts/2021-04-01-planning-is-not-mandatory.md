We’ve all been warned:

_If you fail to plan, you plan to fail._

But that’s like… just your opinion, man. Some undertakings might require a ton of planning - others don’t. Some people might require a ton of planning - others don’t.

Even if additional marginal planning would create benefits, it also incurs a cost. Depending on who you are and what you’re trying to do, **the costs of additional planning can easily exceed the benefits**.

Last but not least, if you’re just not much of a planner, it doesn’t really matter how much that additional planning would \_theoretically\_help. “Ought” implies “can.” **You aren’t morally required to do something that’s impossible for you.**

Good news, though: the alternative to heavy-handed planning isn’t being a fuckup. **There are many other ways to channel your energy towards worthwhile stuff:**

- **Develop (and respect) your intuition** around work, leisure, and rest
- **Choose the right lines of work, lifestyles, and standards** that are inherently consonant with your personality 
- **Create environments that nudge you towards value**
- **Use money, social supports, and/or professionals** to compensate for your lack of planning
- **Ignore the inner critic** that compares you to obsessive planners and tells you that your own lack of planning is _necessarily_ an unforgivable personal failing
- **Remind yourself of your past wins** (and what they did or did not require you to do)
- **Build self-trust** via little tiny successes, repeated ad infinitum 

Were you waiting for permission to give up on the careful planning that was never going to happen consistently for you anyways? Here - tell them I said it was ok.

Don’t let planning propaganda and its lies live inside your head. **Planning is not mandatory.**
