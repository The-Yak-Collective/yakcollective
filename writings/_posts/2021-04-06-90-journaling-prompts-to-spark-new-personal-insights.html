<p>Journaling offers many <a href="https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary">benefits</a>, including improved mood, fewer stress-related visits to the doctor, feeling of greater psychological well-being, reduced depressive symptoms and absenteeism from work, improved working memory, and more. However, many people struggle to build a journaling habit. The blank page of a journal can feel daunting, and many journaling methods assume a well-ingrained discipline. What if you want to journal but don’t feel inspired at all? An easy trick is to use journaling prompts.</p>



<p>Instead of staring at a blank page, wondering what you could be writing about, pick one of the journaling prompts below and write a few sentences—or, if you feel particularly inspired, a few paragraphs. You can even give yourself the challenge of going through these 90 prompts over the course of three months.</p>



<p>Not all of these journaling prompts include a “why” at the end, but it’s a great exercise to explore the reasons and emotions behind your answers. Again, you can make your answers as short as you want, but give yourself the space to dig deeper whenever you feel like you stumbled on an interesting insight.</p>



<p>Now, open your notebook or note-taking app, pick a journaling prompt that inspires you, and spend at least fifteen minutes writing down your thoughts. If you like the experience, block some time in your calendar to try and go through each question over the course of three months.</p>
