<p>Threshold concepts, or gateway ideas, are ideas that, once you get them, change your way of thinking permanently. There’s no going back. And you’re stuck with it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*Djg7qIteD-HthvJhUl3O2A.gif" /></figure><p>Realising that ‘you’re not the child your parent had in mind’ (as Peter Block says) is a big one.</p><p>Deep systems insights like power+systems dynamics or the Viable Systems Model are very much in this category.</p><p>Understanding that aggression often comes from being wounded and attempting to protect that wound.</p><p>I think that my RedQuadrant tool shed is full of these kinds of concepts, the things which shaped my thinking and which I never looked back from.</p><p>Meyer and Land, the scholars of this, say</p><p>“‘Threshold Concepts’ may be considered to be “akin to passing through a portal” or “conceptual gateway” that opens up “previously inaccessible way[s] of thinking about something”</p><p>This doesn’t mean they are Eternal Truths For The Ages — it means that they change something in you — and as Marshall McLuhan said, ‘every extension is an amputation’. Good threshold concepts empower, inspire, and transcend and include.</p><p><strong>What springs to mind for you as the big idea which changed you permanently?</strong></p><p>For more on the RedQuadrant tool shed and going through some boundary concepts with me and a group of peers, see</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_the-redquadrant-tool-shed-overview-activity-6787994187867402240-BY3V/">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_the-redquadrant-tool-shed-overview-activity-6787994187867402240-BY3V/</a></p><p>You can read more about this thresholds idea via <a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/12/03/the-threshold-concept-an-introduction-and-overview-to-the-concept/">https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/12/03/the-threshold-concept-an-introduction-and-overview-to-the-concept/</a></p><p>and an allied concept in learning here: <a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2020/04/05/theory-legitimation-code-theory-and-semantic-waves/">https://stream.syscoi.com/2020/04/05/theory-legitimation-code-theory-and-semantic-waves/</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2fd33baec887" width="1" height="1" alt="">
