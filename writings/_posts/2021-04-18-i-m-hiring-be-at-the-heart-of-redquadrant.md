I’m hiring! Be at the heart of RedQuadrant

### RedQuadrant is looking for a ‘hub’ person, to lead our bid support and admin coordination, working directly to Managing Partner, Benjamin Taylor.

It’s an initial one-year contract, £28–32k with room to grow, remote for the foreseeable future, really at the heart of growing a business — ideally it would be someone with

(1) bid management

(2) admin/operations management, and

(3) consultancy/public sector experience

…but what’s important is hard work and passion to be part of what we do and help us to grow. Please share to anyone who might be interested!

More details:

Full time, remote working for the foreseeable future, initial twelve-month contract with three month probation period, potential to become permanent.

Role to commence first half of May.

£28–32k with room to develop.

You will work directly to the Managing Partner and liaise with service leads and consultants, acting as the reliable centre of the business. This is a role at the heart of a great organisation, with the potential to grow with us and be a recognised and valued leader.

RedQuadrant is a radical, ethical public service transformation consultancy which has survived and thrived in possibly the twelve hardest years for UK public services in living memory (including 2020), and which leads and supports the Public Service Transformation Academy, a not-for-profit social enterprise dedicated to building capability for public services to transform themselves. Please check our websites for more.

We need someone extremely well organised, solid, capable, and hard-working to run our bids, oversee our operations, and co-ordinate flexible hourly admin support and possibly interns and graduates, as well as linking to our small finance team.

The primary task is to provide solid backing to our bid process from opportunity review, supplier portal, framework, and compliance management to bid development, submission, and contract signing. This involves working with our service leads and expert independent consultants, and being on top of our existing material, prior bids, and compliance questions, outlining and quality assuring content, and directing process. An appetite for organising the complex and a will to win are critical.

Alongside this runs knowledge management (in Microsoft 365/SharePoint), tracking of other business leads, and maintenance of pipeline and monitoring. None of this is solo work — but you need to be the coordinator and the unfailing central point of reference for bid leads, consultants, and administrative assistance.

The secondary task is to grow into ensuring that the business runs smoothly and works dynamically to increase impact, reach, and profit, freeing the Managing Partner from operational responsibilities and working together to create new opportunities.
