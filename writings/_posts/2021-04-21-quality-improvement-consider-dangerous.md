### Quality Improvement — consider dangerous?

[#QualityImprovement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=qualityimprovement&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6790530533421129728) can be dangerous.

Very popular in the NHS, and beyond. Very good, in context. Our clients are doing our systems-flavoured [#LeadingTransformation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=leadingtransformation&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6790530533421129728) programme, and asked me how it fits with [#QI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=qi&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6790530533421129728).

This isn’t new, and I constantly say: ‘but \*really good\* QI people look outside the box at this stuff’.

But QI should be considered dangerous.

It’s a powerful weapon if you aim it right; if you know the problem, and it’s a process problem.

BUT:

Drucker: ‘There is nothing quite so useless, as doing with great efficiency, something that should not be done at all.’

You have to look at the frame the [#process](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=process&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6790530533421129728) fits inside — is the process meaningful?

\> In Ackoff’s terms, can you \*dissolve\* the problem by redesigning the context?

\> In the RedQuadrant five worlds, QI is in service world — you have to look out to customer world and management and leadership worlds

\> In ‘seven ways to save and improve’, QI cuts waste and optimises resources — and should look at shaping demand and economies of flow.

\> In the Viable Systems Model, QI works on S1 and S2, and needs to connect to the other systems

\> and you need to connect to future needs, or your optimised process might be washed away.

Some examples in the document attached.

\>\>\> What’s \*your\* experience?
