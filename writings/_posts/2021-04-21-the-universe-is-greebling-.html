<h3>New innovations add more and more layers of details. Those layers of details create new spaces, new possibilities, new ideas.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*aGCnpKp4rpHytseIoy9iOA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Greebling (and degreebling)</figcaption></figure><p>It happens in ecologies, with evolution. In economies, with innovation. And in thoughtspace — every brilliant new meme, every time a critic gets *just* the right phrase to explain the dynamics of a new movie or the emotions it provokes.</p><p>Every new thing that comes into being to fit into a space not only creates new space, new gaps, new niches; that thing can then be used in *new* and innovative ways.</p><p>Call it preadaptation, exaptation, or an affordance; using a thing that came into being for one purpose, for a different purpose; new possibilities.</p><p>Like the shoreline paradox — the more finely you measure a shoreline, the longer it is — this means our living world is constantly getting bigger and bigger, as it can be measured in different ways.</p><p>And every new space creates new sensors which create new worlds of experience.</p><p>Everything we do supports the unfolding and self-expression of the universe.</p><p>This ongoing complexification, this galactic unfurling, creates new worlds and new possibilities faster than we can imagine.</p><h3>What’s your favourite new thing, idea, adaptation, possibility?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b89c3ac5269f" width="1" height="1" alt="">
