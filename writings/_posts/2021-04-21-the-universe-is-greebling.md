### New innovations add more and more layers of details. Those layers of details create new spaces, new possibilities, new ideas.

_Greebling (and degreebling)_

It happens in ecologies, with evolution. In economies, with innovation. And in thoughtspace — every brilliant new meme, every time a critic gets \*just\* the right phrase to explain the dynamics of a new movie or the emotions it provokes.

Every new thing that comes into being to fit into a space not only creates new space, new gaps, new niches; that thing can then be used in \*new\* and innovative ways.

Call it preadaptation, exaptation, or an affordance; using a thing that came into being for one purpose, for a different purpose; new possibilities.

Like the shoreline paradox — the more finely you measure a shoreline, the longer it is — this means our living world is constantly getting bigger and bigger, as it can be measured in different ways.

And every new space creates new sensors which create new worlds of experience.

Everything we do supports the unfolding and self-expression of the universe.

This ongoing complexification, this galactic unfurling, creates new worlds and new possibilities faster than we can imagine.

### What’s your favourite new thing, idea, adaptation, possibility?
