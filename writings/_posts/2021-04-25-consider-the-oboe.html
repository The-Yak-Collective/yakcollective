<h3>What’s your favourite example to illustrate radically different ‘worlds’?</h3><h4>Consider the #oboe.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*SoZ-_LJiejmULO-QSb1yCA.gif" /></figure><p>It’s a weird instrument; one of the most ancient.</p><p>To play it requires immense skill, and the patience to spend hours crafting the reeds necessary to make any sound at all.</p><p>Early pictorial examples of a double-reed instrument resembling the oboe have been found in Sumeria dating back to 2800 BC, and there are a slew of jokes about oboists to be found on the internet.</p><p>It’s one of the hardest instruments to get a tone, and used to tune the rest of the audience.</p><p>But the oboe isn’t alone in being idiosyncratic.</p><p>An old joke talks about #relationships between different orchestra roles:</p><p>&gt;&gt; The second violist drove home to find a police cordon. “I’m so sorry,” the officer said, “but the conductor came to your house, stole your wife, killed your dog, and burned down the house.”</p><p>The astonished violist responded, “The MAESTRO? Came to MY house?”</p><p>In life, and in organisations, different #roles aren’t simply interchangeable job descriptions.</p><p>They are different #worlds, places where we’re under different pressures, we have different practices. The world of the oboist is different from the world of the trombonist.</p><p>What’s your example of different #sensemaking worlds?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4e7f9cd107" width="1" height="1" alt="">
