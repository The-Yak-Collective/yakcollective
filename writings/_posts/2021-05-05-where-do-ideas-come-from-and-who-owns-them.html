<p>There’s an interesting conversation in the fringes of the debate around the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=doublediamond&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6795601313569882112">#DoubleDiamond</a> for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=designthinking&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6795601313569882112">#designthinking</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=servicedesign&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6795601313569882112">#servicedesign</a> from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/design-council/">Design Council</a>, as a new iteration of their approach is launched.</p><p>It’s a nice example because it doesn’t seem to involve vitriol or dissembling, as you find so often in these situations.</p><p>It seems clear that the double diamond emerged from extensive group work in 2005, that it owes a large debt to Bela Banathy’s 1996 ‘Designing Social Systems in a Changing World’ (you can see both images in the gif), and also that there were some other uses of both the double diamond model — and the divergent and convergent thinking in phases that it represents — around at the time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*-5NPi_OTily1CQ4lQLOE0Q.gif" /></figure><p>But did the Banathy double diamond provide the actual model (consciously or unconsciously), or was it just floating there behind them all?</p><p>Does it matter?</p><p>When we genuinely believe we invented something — but it turns out it just wasn’t for the first time? (There’s a nice example in a stinging review of Wolfram’s work I link to below).</p><p>When we’ve used something so long in a different way that it’s not reducible to the original model?</p><p>How do we pay proper respect, when even simple lines of inheritance become unclear in human lives?</p><p>My research into this question is here:</p><p><a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/05/05/the-double-diamond-as-an-example-of-some-challenges-of-attribution-in-the-history-of-ideas/">https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/05/05/the-double-diamond-as-an-example-of-some-challenges-of-attribution-in-the-history-of-ideas/</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7f9a2dc9862e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
