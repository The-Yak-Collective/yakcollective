### For years, I’ve been struggling with three tough challenges:

How to:

\> run a network **#consultancy** : better consultancy at better value, focus on clients and consultants as well as business

\> teach and share the good stuff (systems/complexity/cybernetics, public service transformation), steer away from dodgy stuff, without professional sclerosis or certificate milling

\> support active communities of practice/enquiry to build and share learning, mutual support, inspiration

I’ve made progress!

At [**RedQuadrant**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) we stick to our principles and provide excellent client value.

The RedQuadrant **#toolshed** , the work I’ve supported at [**SCiO — Systems and Complexity in Organisation**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) **#professionall** accreditation and the apprenticeship), the Systems Community of Inquiry, other forums, the work we do at [**The Public Service Transformation Academy**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/), have helped.

AND

Talking to [**Mikael Seppälä**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) and [**Pekka Enroth**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) recently, I suddenly realised they can be seen as three aspects of the same problem — a problem to do with creating contexts for **#learning** , **#sharing** , and **#impact**. This opens up new possibilities!

Come to my talk at [**Systems Change Finland**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) if you want to join this debate!
