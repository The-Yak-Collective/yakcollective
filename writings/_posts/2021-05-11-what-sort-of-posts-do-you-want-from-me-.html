<p>I send out a constant stream of updates at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/antlerboy">www.linkedin.com/in/antlerboy</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/antlerboy,">www.twitter.com/antlerboy,</a> relating to my interests — <strong>#publicservices</strong> <strong>#transformation</strong> <strong>#complexity</strong> <strong>#systemsthinking</strong> <strong>#cybernetics</strong></p><p>Three times a week I do ‘featured’ posts on LinkedIn and here — much longer.</p><p>I like to say things ‘rough and ready’ — recently got feedback from a submission to an academic blog that removed my negative comments (critiques), and references. And I often have typos or imperfections.</p><p>Does this matter? Please answer the simple poll, I’m fascinated to hear what — and how — people would like to hear from me!</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_publicservices-transformation-complexity-activity-6798136898427719680-NR-9">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_publicservices-transformation-complexity-activity-6798136898427719680-NR-9</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/552/0*geMIMnFhjnTAUEOi.jpg" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d5db4b9e41f4" width="1" height="1" alt="">
