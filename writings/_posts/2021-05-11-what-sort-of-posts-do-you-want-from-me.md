I send out a constant stream of updates at [www.linkedin.com/in/antlerboy](http://www.linkedin.com/in/antlerboy) and [www.twitter.com/antlerboy,](http://www.twitter.com/antlerboy,) relating to my interests —  **#publicservices**  **#transformation**  **#complexity**  **#systemsthinking**  **#cybernetics**

Three times a week I do ‘featured’ posts on LinkedIn and here — much longer.

I like to say things ‘rough and ready’ — recently got feedback from a submission to an academic blog that removed my negative comments (critiques), and references. And I often have typos or imperfections.

Does this matter? Please answer the simple poll, I’m fascinated to hear what — and how — people would like to hear from me!
