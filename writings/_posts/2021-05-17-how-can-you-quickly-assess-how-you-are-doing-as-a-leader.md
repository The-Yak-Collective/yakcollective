### **And how are you _actually_ doing?**

Hint: it doesn’t involve navel-gazing, it needs you to  **#gosee**

This is a follow-on to my post about ‘ten principles for (public) service **#transformation** ’ (see here for more: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy\_redquadrant-ten-principles-for-service-activity-6798501196282892288-tWom/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_redquadrant-ten-principles-for-service-activity-6798501196282892288-tWom/)).

It’s about how you run the **#organisation** in a context of meeting citizen and community needs — or, better, help them to avoid ‘needs’ and do what they want in their lives.

Like all these things, the reality is nuanced and hard to do full justice to in a LinkedIn post.

But have a look — which of these are you doing really well on?

Which give rise to questions?

**#complexity**  **#publicservice**

Note that this is very much an incremental improvement on being ‘organisation focused’ — it doesn’t start with centring in community, place, partnership but it starts with orienting the organisation to be able to do those things… and is still very much work in progress!
