<h3>Come and sample the RedQuadrant tool shed — free show and tell on 10 June</h3><p>I’d love to invite ‘my readers’ to a free show-and-tell for the RedQuadrant tool shed, my small group co-learning approach drawing on all the tools, methods, perspectives that I use. It has been a big hit with the cohorts who have done it so far.</p><p>The exploratory sessions will be on 10 June at different times for different time zones — please see here for more info and booking links:</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/RQtoolshedshownandtell">An invitation to the RedQuadrant tool shed</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b984683a5cb6" width="1" height="1" alt="">
