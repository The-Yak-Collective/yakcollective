### Come and sample the RedQuadrant tool shed — free show and tell on 10 June

I’d love to invite ‘my readers’ to a free show-and-tell for the RedQuadrant tool shed, my small group co-learning approach drawing on all the tools, methods, perspectives that I use. It has been a big hit with the cohorts who have done it so far.

The exploratory sessions will be on 10 June at different times for different time zones — please see here for more info and booking links:
