<h3>There are ‘five worlds’ in any service, especially #publicservices, or #systemschange</h3><p>A simplification that can help understanding, from a small service to a whole place-based system</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*zBMa-gTq_WVpD857" /></figure><p>In citizen (customer) world, we live our lives, trying to achieve our purposes. We prefer to get on with things ourselves; sometimes we need help, sometimes we even create demand for a service.</p><p>In #service world, we have to adapt and respond to all the #complexity coming from citizen world; pragmatism is needed</p><p>In #management world, we have to help service world work more-or-less logically as an #organisation</p><p>In #leadership world, we set the overall culture and purpose</p><p>And, sometimes, we’re all in the world of learning and change; learning from now, anticipating the future, learning either way.</p><p>Each world speaks a very different language, experiences ‘their part of the elephant’ very differently.</p><p>Understanding this, and linking the worlds better, is the first insight.</p><p>The second is that we are all citizens or customers; all these worlds are part of citizen world. It’s Asset-Based Community Development, it’s democracy.</p><p>The third is that we are all learning all the time, in all the worlds.</p><p><strong>What do you see about your service using the lens of the ‘five worlds’?</strong></p><p>This formulation is inspired by the viable systems model, though it grew from a ‘three worlds’ model I developed back in about 2003, partly inspired by the standard Vanguard Consulting speech. It was then informed by Barry Oshry’s power+systems model and the Viable Systems Model itself, and came together in a prototype form in early slides for the Cabinet Office Commissioning Academy, and was significantly advanced by collaboration with these good folks on a RedQuadrant bid in 2016: Jane Searles, Rob Worth, Arthur Battram, Philip Hellyer, Pauline Roberts, and Russell Gundry.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=916c41f529fa" width="1" height="1" alt="">
