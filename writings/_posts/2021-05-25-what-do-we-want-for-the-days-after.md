As we move into the uncertain future, on 23 June we convene public service learners to review our journey so far.

[Learning never stops: the days after - a learning community to build back better - our Government After Shock event on November 17 - PSTA](https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2020/04/the-days-after-a-learning-community-to-build-back-better/)

[Join us](https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2020/04/the-days-after-a-learning-community-to-build-back-better/) as we consider:

- what have we learned on the journey so far?

- what do we mourn?

- what do we celebrate?

- what are our determinations for the future?

- how will we adapt?
