<p>The idea I want to talk about this week is a pretty simple one: </p><p><em><strong>Every philosophical idea you appreciate pairs with a problem you&#8217;ve decided to live with in your life. So the more philosophical you are, the more problems you&#8217;ve decided to live with rather than solve.</strong></em></p><p>Or to put it more simply, philosophical ideas are <em>copes</em>. But that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad&#8230;</p>
