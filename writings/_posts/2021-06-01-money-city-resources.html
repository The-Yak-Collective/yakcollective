<p>A few months back I <a href="https://blog.randylubin.com/serious-games-future-of-money-run-at-mozfest">wrote all about</a> the ‘Future of Money’ game that I designed with The Copia Institute and that we ran at MozFest. Now we have lots more to share, with the game renamed to Money City.</p>

<p>We’ve now released all of the materials from the game under a CC-BY license and created a Facilitators Guide so that anyone can run it. Check out the guide and resources in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jxSxpF8vAO54puua9hK20z3y6Ei_y9am">Money City playkit folder</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also created recaps of how the three sessions went at Mozfest. You can read those in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XHm12b86WIKU1P53vL5uP3zi0CVacQ5_">Money City recap folder</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out a podcast of Mike and I talking about designing the game with Chris and Erika from Grant for the Web (our sponsors): <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210601/12082146907/techdirt-podcast-episode-285-welcome-to-money-city.shtml" title="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210601/12082146907/techdirt-podcast-episode-285-welcome-to-money-city.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210601/12082146907/techdirt-podcast-episode-285-welcome-to-money-city.shtml</a></p>
