<h3>I don’t quite know why this distinction is so valuable to people — but it is!</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e_sigEYOmTPAgZRA" /></figure><p>The attached is from a recent session to introduce a group to Adaptive Leadership, working alongside a genuine expert (I’m a sceptical, engaged dabbler).</p><p>Their challenge:<br><strong>what to do about home/hybrid working post-pandemic?</strong></p><p>Should people work from home? Be forced into the office? Be flexible? If work can be done from anywhere, should it just be outsourced to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=india&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6806111293842583552">#India</a>? It’s clear that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=humanresources&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6806111293842583552">#humanresources</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=innovation&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6806111293842583552">#innovation</a> is required.</p><p>The fundamental distinction in approach between technical/programmatic/linear change and adaptive or complex/wicked/messy/social change is at the heart of Adaptive Leadership.</p><p>It’s given in full (my version) on slide 4 of the attached.</p><p>File: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eylfm096y23yu7k/Benjamin%20Taylor%20-%20a%20core%20element%20of%20Adaptive%20Leadership.pdf?dl=0"><strong>A core element of Adaptive Leadership — distinguishing technical from adaptive aspects of change</strong></a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4u_eiTW70KuWt6yxSdDg3w.png" /></figure><p>I have so many reservations about blending together all these technical definitions to give people this core differentiation — and I have reservations about Adaptive Leadership itself.</p><p>But just having people think about the distinction, work through which parts of their challenge fit into which category, is so powerful.<br>It generates so many breakthroughs. And most importantly, changes in thinking.</p><h3>What do you think? Can you take a challenge you are faced with and identify the technical and the adaptive elements?</h3><p>I mention my reservations. They are twofold:</p><ol><li>I have seen people go more, and more disastrously, wrong with Adaptive Leadership than with most other approaches. It feels more like a leadership model reacting against a broken system, than a complete approach in itself. It recommends flexibility and perspective — which is great — but does not seem to have guard-rails to really help people evaluate how they are doing.</li><li>My slide intentionally blends a bunch of relevant, technical, and important distinctions. Not many socially complex problems are truly ‘wicked problems’ in the definition. Yet after a lot of experimentation, the many issues this allows people to consider — and the normalisation and recognition of aspects of their challenges otherwise unspoken and not brought into real consideration — seems to add a lot of value.</li></ol><p>I’d love to teach people more about what I think leadership intrinsicaly requires, and differentiate more properly between ways they might usefully conceptualise their challenges. And often I do so. But this… this unlocks a lot!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f4da46d73e29" width="1" height="1" alt="">
