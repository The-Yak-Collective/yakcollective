<h3>There is no transformation without insight.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/593/0*dh2jgJumokLIuxKu" /></figure><p>Helping actual customer or citizens achieve their purposes is the purpose of organisations.</p><p>Yet organisations in public and private sector are often like the drunk under the streetlamp — looking where they can see, not where the keys are.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/996/0*OYaV5zxuv1InjzMn" /></figure><p>It’s important to understand there are two different dimensions in insight:</p><p>FIRST, which world the data comes from:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*b31hiO4ynbDLRrXWEFF4aQ.png" /></figure><ul><li>citizen/customer world where we live our lives</li><li>service world where we deal with demand</li><li>management world where we try to make the whole thing function</li><li>board or political world where we try to steer while staying in charge</li></ul><p>It’s <em>so</em> easy to forget that we are <em>all</em> customers and citizens. Not least because even <em>the same</em> data changes every time it crosses the boundary between worlds.</p><p>SECOND, the <em>type</em> of data we are looking at. Is it about who, where, why, when, what, or how the customer or citizen is contacting us.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/975/0*e3mq7FkUkT9TAEiS" /></figure><p>The attached grid allows you to think differently about your customer or citizen insight.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0H0MG__qq9W3k6fX" /></figure><p>My big advice is <em>triangulate</em> — make sure all insight covers all three columns and at least three rows in the grid. This is a rule of thumb for generating <em>real</em> insight that can drive transformation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*b31hiO4ynbDLRrXWEFF4aQ.png" /></figure><h3>What’s your favourite tip for customer or citizen insight?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fe3fad5f9c21" width="1" height="1" alt="">
