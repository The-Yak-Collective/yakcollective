The changes I outlined in the last newsletter ([Upcoming Changes](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/upcoming-changes), June 9) have now been executed. This newsletter is now officially the **Ribbonfarm Studio** newsletter. If you missed the last issue and are confused, the tldr is: this is what used to be the **Breaking Smart** newsletter.

This is just a housekeeping newsletter issue to the whole list, to flag the logistical changes and make sure email delivery is working properly after the changeover. A regular subscribers-only issue with real content should also go out later today.

The new home of the newsletter is at **[studio.ribbonfarm.com](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/)**, a subdomain of my main **[ribbonfarm.com](https://ribbonfarm.com)** blog site. All twitter updates will now come from the **[@ribbonfarm](https://twitter.com/ribbonfarm)** account, and the **@breaking\_smart** account will be retired. Due to some pretty clean engineering by Substack, all the old **breakingsmart.substack.com** links seem to be automatically redirecting appropriately. You _may_ need to sign in again to re-establish cookies or something. Let me know if you have any issues.

Here’s a convenient graphic representing the relationship I envision going forward.

I have also turned off the podcast feature, but old podcast episodes should still work fine. I just won’t be doing new ones.

Each studio project now has a home page within the Substack site, and links to the indexes can be found in the right sidebar of the Substack homepage:

The Breaking Smart brand and the [breakingsmart.com](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/) site are now restricted to the original set of essays about software eating the world, and older newsletter issues from 2015-19 which mainly built on that original theme. I’ll likely be doing some more clean-up to untangle commingled content.

As I explained in the last issue, this is both a name change and a bit of an editorial pivot. I hope you’ll enjoy the changes.

Subscribers — you can expect a proper issue later today.
