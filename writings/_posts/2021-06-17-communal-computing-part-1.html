<h4>How do we build devices that are shared by default?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*doLoRusr3ac4jE_6IwJG7w.jpeg" /><figcaption><em>LG Smart Refrigerator, CES 2011.

Anyone within reach (or voice) can use them. I’ve written the first post in a series for the O’Reilly Radar blog on how these devices are framed, designed, and built <strong>wrong</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/">Communal Computing</a></p><p>The reason they are “wrong” is that they are built with one person in mind: the owner of the device. Whereas there are many people in a home that could use it.</p><p>The problems start out as weirdness like your Spotify playlist starts to have recommendations for songs you don’t like. It escalates until you don’t trust the device at all.</p><p>In the first post we talk about how we got here. The kitchen phone with a long cord was an early communal device. Through academia and research building multi-tenant computing systems. Ending with home assistants like the Amazon Echo and Google Home Hub.</p><p>We touch on different computing movements like ubiquitous, ambient, and omnichannel. They are all considering what it means to make computing interwoven with our physical experiences.</p><p>Through this series we will consider the types of problems in identity, privacy, security, experience, and ownership. From there I’ll give dos/don’ts when framing, designing, and building these devices.</p><p>Hope this starts some interesting conversations on how many different devices really are communal ones!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f871c6bc5257" width="1" height="1" alt="">
