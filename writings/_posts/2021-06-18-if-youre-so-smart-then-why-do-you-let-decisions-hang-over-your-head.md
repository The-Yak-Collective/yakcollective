If You’re So Smart, Then Why Do You Let Decisions Hang Over Your Head?

There’s some decision for you to make: about a job, relationship, move, trip, purchase, etc.

_Maybe it’s huge, maybe it’s medium, maybe it’s small_

Because this decision isn’t _strictly_ urgent, **you think about it now and then… without really getting anywhere.**

_Maybe you think about it daily, weekly, or monthly._

_Maybe the cycles’s been dragging on literally for years._

**The decision has now stagnated.** You think in the same circle, hoping to find something new, but it only entrenches you further. Fun!

### What causes decision stagnation?

Decision stagnation is common, and the causes of decision stagnation are clear:

- simple inertia,
- wanting to preserve optionality,
- inability to get the right information,
- unwillingness to _stop_ research when its marginal value plummets,
- managing (i.e. avoiding) tough emotions around uncertainty & risk

Decision stagnation sometimes takes a particularly cerebral form, though.

**Smart people can generate an endless number of considerations, possibilities, eventualities, etc to feed into inner deliberations.**

**This shifting mess is easily mistaken for careful, nuanced thinking.** It’s hard to call decision stagnation for what it turns into: garden-variety procrastination.

Decision stagnation is like a “first-world problem” of personal development. It runs rampant among those blessed with skills, means, social connections, health, and imagination. Decision stagnation probably won’t ruin your life, but it’s no picnic…

## What’s wrong with letting a decision hang over your head?

Decision stagnation will erode your quality of life day by day, if you let it. **Open loops create leaks in your psychic economy.**

Even when thinking about a stalled decision doesn’t take up too much time, it could be sopping up plenty of energy: emotional energy, motivation, confidence, etc.

When a decision has stagnated and you keep it on simmer for a while anyways, that simmer bears some cost that’s become disproportionate to the benefit.

It’s not like simmering chili that becomes better with age, folks. Instead, you’re turning your pasta mushy :(

## How to solve decision stagnation

**First, you need to make the**  **metadecision:** should I make this decision right now?

**If the answer is no** : then decide to decide later and put the decision out of your mind.

**If the answer is yes** : then make your decision in a time-bounded and actionable manner.

**You give the decision more attention, by escalating it, or you give it less attention, on the back burner.**

That’s it!

## Not sure how to make a meta-decision?
