[Our iconography for linear navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_control_symbols) was lifted from olde technology, the VCR, which borrowed it from audio cassette players like the Sony Walkman that recycled commands from [larger reel to reel audio tape machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollensak).

We need a new iconography for identity interaction. Which interactions? What are the identity conversations people want to have with familiar and strange devices?

### Before

- ![▶](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/25b6.png) Can you (or a proxy) have a digital identity conversation with me? Are you able and/or willing?
- If you’re unwilling, tell me enough to follow up elsewhere.

### Getting acquainted

- Tell me a little about yourself.
- What’s your name?
- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- What’s your history?
- Where did you come from?

### About me

- What do you know about me?
- May I introduce myself?
- What may I do with you?
- Could I do more with more permission? From whom?

### About the folks behind you

- What groups are you a part of?
- Who is your guardian?
- Who controls you, if not your guardian?
- What do you do with information you collect? What do _they_ do with the information? Who do you trust?
- Where does the information go? Physically, I mean. Does it leave the neighborhood? The country?
- What jurisdictions apply to you?
- Who governs you? What trade, safety, industry, or regulatory bodies?

### About your needs and wants

- Who takes care of you?
- If you’re abandoned, what happens to you?
- What do you need to survive? To flourish?
- Are you subject to human rights laws? Civil rights laws? Are you more than property?

### After

- How can I subscribe, follow, join your circle?
- Would you like to be in a relationship with me? Will you accept my contractual ToS?

### Meta

- Who is assuring me this conversation should be trusted?
- How do I report a problem with this conversation or its content?

I expect many media for these conversations. Oral dialogs in hands-free spaces, textual chat, audible feedback to gestural queries.
