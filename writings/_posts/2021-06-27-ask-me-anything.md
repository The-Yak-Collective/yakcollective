I’m trying out ‘Racket’ — so you have a chance to ask me about

**Systems | Cybernetics | Complexity in Public | Service | Transformation…**

and anything else you’d like…

And on Wednesday I’m hosting the Public Sector Show — a brilliant conference starting on Tuesday.

Free tickets still available — [https://publicsectorshow.co.uk/](https://publicsectorshow.co.uk/).

The best questions will go into the discussions, which are not only about procurement, they’re fundamentally about how we can transform public outcomes.

### Leave a 30-second voicemail here and I’ll reply:

Or you can just ask me in the comments — what questions do you have for me?
