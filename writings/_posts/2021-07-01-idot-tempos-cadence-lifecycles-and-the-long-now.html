<p>So, a few notes on the rising tempo gaps between things, makers, humans, &amp; flocks:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">1.</p>



<p><strong>Devices </strong>can be in service for decades. Buildings. Tractors. Prostheses. Solar panels. </p>



<p>Devices are often not supported through their whole lives, as their makers <em>a.</em> retire them as products or <em>b.</em> close as an enterprise, abandoning the devices.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">2.</p>



<p>Most security and identity <strong>protocols </strong>are obsolesced in a decade or sooner. </p>



<p>They may linger. But modest revisions and major rethinking happen often. </p>



<p>Drift happens.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">3.</p>



<p>Many limitations of IoT identity architecture and implementation are handled by <strong>people</strong>.</p>



<p>People in fluid organizations. </p>



<p>Organizations that own devices, make them, and augment them. </p>



<p>Organizations that reorganize, restructure, are M&amp;A&#8217;d, and otherwise disrupted. So much that human knowledge of how to care for the fleet and overcome identity shortcomings are subject to interruption, bad hand-offs, personnel layoffs and retirement and transfers, changing priorities, etc. </p>



<p>Insitutional failures are guaranteed over the long lives of devices. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">4.</p>



<p>We expect more services to help with <strong>flocking </strong>and orchestration of device-to-device trusted relationships.</p>



<p>Swarms formed <em>ad hoc </em>will last briefly.</p>



<p>The collectives formed from devices (hospital rooms, smart buildings, a wind turbine) may last much longer than their constituent things.</p>

<p>So, where and how does this impact: </p>



<ul><li>Futureproofing product designs (before shipping) </li><li>Futureproofing by IdentityOps (lifecycle management, IDoT life extension services)</li><li>Futureproofing by contract (among the many parties that affect or are affected by devices and their services) </li><li>Contract survivability</li><li>Auditability  </li><li>Device sustainability and longevity. </li></ul>



<p>  <a href="https://wider.team/tag/complexity/">When we talk about <span style="color:#990000;" class="has-inline-color">identity complexity</span></a>, this is one of those complexifiers.</p>
