> **Thought experiment:** Would you trust your life to any of the identity technologies of twenty years’ ago? I wouldn’t. Would you trust today’s twenty years from now? No. Digital identity is a briskly moving target.

So, a few notes on the rising tempo gaps between things, makers, humans, & flocks:

1.

**Devices** can be in service for decades. Buildings. Tractors. Prostheses. Solar panels.

Devices are often not supported through their whole lives, as their makers _a._ retire them as products or _b._ close as an enterprise, abandoning the devices.

2.

Most security and identity **protocols** are obsolesced in a decade or sooner.

They may linger. But modest revisions and major rethinking happen often.

Drift happens.

3.

Many limitations of IoT identity architecture and implementation are handled by **people**.

People in fluid organizations.

Organizations that own devices, make them, and augment them.

Organizations that reorganize, restructure, are M&A’d, and otherwise disrupted. So much that human knowledge of how to care for the fleet and overcome identity shortcomings are subject to interruption, bad hand-offs, personnel layoffs and retirement and transfers, changing priorities, etc.

Insitutional failures are guaranteed over the long lives of devices.

4.

We expect more services to help with **flocking** and orchestration of device-to-device trusted relationships.

Swarms formed _ad hoc_ will last briefly.

The collectives formed from devices (hospital rooms, smart buildings, a wind turbine) may last much longer than their constituent things.

So, where and how does this impact:

- Futureproofing product designs (before shipping) 
- Futureproofing by IdentityOps (lifecycle management, IDoT life extension services)
- Futureproofing by contract (among the many parties that affect or are affected by devices and their services) 
- Contract survivability
- Auditability 
- Device sustainability and longevity. 

[When we talk about identity complexity](https://wider.team/tag/complexity/), this is one of those complexifiers.
