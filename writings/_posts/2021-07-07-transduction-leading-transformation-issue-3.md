### Transduction — leading transformation — Issue #3

It’s been a busy week, including:

- A review after the end of a three-year capability building contract with a client which revealed that… we had very successfully helped them to grow their capacity! Case study coming soon.
- The reunion of our _learning community to build back better in the days after_, reflecting on the challenges being faced by public services and how we can help to shift the dial tovalue ‘the things we value’: [https://buildbackbetter.groups.io/](https://buildbackbetter.groups.io/)
- The last of four ‘tour’ sessions of the RedQuadrant tool shed: [https://chosen-path.org/2020/08/28/an-invitation-to-the-redquadrant-tool-shed/](https://buildbackbetter.groups.io/)

Come along — signup is free. It’s billed as ‘the event for private & public sector procurement leads to join and help create more efficient public services at better value for money’ but we have been working on ensuring that a ‘radical procurement’ stream is included, so one look at the agenda will show you that there are a lot of interesting sessions even if you’re not a procurement specialist.
