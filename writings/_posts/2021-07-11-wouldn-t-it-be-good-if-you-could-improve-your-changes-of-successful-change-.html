<h3>Is your pattern of change interventions on track for success — or failure?</h3><p>I really believe that more than 70% of change fails to achieve its goals.</p><p>In fact, my former business partner ennis Vergne proved it in his research. He studied ten major change programmes for his MSc — in each, over 40 jobs disappeared or completely changed.</p><p>Every single ‘change intervention’ — meeting, training, newsletter, Town Hall meeting, briefing, etc — was categorised and analysed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/0*EUnihLC64TOMwtfc" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/995/0*u-GHB6ssseKN9nY_" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Seven out of ten failed. </strong>In those programmes, changed was about 80% top-down, structural, directive.</li><li><strong>Only three succeeded. </strong>In those programmes, change was about 70% bottom-up, emergent, driven by the people doing the work.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/978/0*isTa8_Wqk-pGXBnw" /></figure><p>You can analyse your attempts at change — what’s the balance between directive, top-down and emergent, bottom-up?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/982/0*yvZr51unSm49x3ZJ" /></figure><p>Or you can focus on defining more clearly the *actual* requirements from the change, the must-haves and must-nots — and giving real freedom to those affected to define the answers within those boundaries.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fflsPPXG9uqpWeBC" /></figure><h3>What sort of change approach do you see around you? What do you see working? Failing?</h3><p><strong>slides: </strong><a href="https://chosenpath.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/redquadrant-how-to-help-your-change-succeed-with-vecit.pdf"><strong>RedQuadrant — how to help your change to succeed with VECIT interventions</strong></a></p><p>I’d love to hear your reflections on this thinking about organisational change!</p><p>There’s a lot more to be said about this, but I’ll just say</p><ul><li>we suspect that this is because most change is complex/social, and is poorly served by a programmatic approach</li><li>the ‘three box model’ (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_redquadrant-the-three-box-model-activity-6747423779552661504-pOiZ">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_redquadrant-the-three-box-model-activity-6747423779552661504-pOiZ</a>) is a brilliant tool to optimise the balance between top-down and bottom-up — because in any traditional organisation, there’s always going to be this kind of balance.</li></ul><p>By the way, 95% top-down and 95% bottom-up change were *so* disastrous that they didn’t it into the full study — not enough data, as they crashed and burned very early.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cdf68fe69bda" width="1" height="1" alt="">
