  Wouldn’t it be good if you could improve your changes of successful change?

### Is your pattern of change interventions on track for success — or failure?

I really believe that more than 70% of change fails to achieve its goals.

In fact, my former business partner ennis Vergne proved it in his research. He studied ten major change programmes for his MSc — in each, over 40 jobs disappeared or completely changed.

Every single ‘change intervention’ — meeting, training, newsletter, Town Hall meeting, briefing, etc — was categorised and analysed.

- **Seven out of ten failed.** In those programmes, changed was about 80% top-down, structural, directive.
- **Only three succeeded.** In those programmes, change was about 70% bottom-up, emergent, driven by the people doing the work.

You can analyse your attempts at change — what’s the balance between directive, top-down and emergent, bottom-up?

Or you can focus on defining more clearly the \*actual\* requirements from the change, the must-haves and must-nots — and giving real freedom to those affected to define the answers within those boundaries.

### What sort of change approach do you see around you? What do you see working? Failing?

**slides:** [**RedQuadrant — how to help your change to succeed with VECIT interventions**](https://chosenpath.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/redquadrant-how-to-help-your-change-succeed-with-vecit.pdf)

I’d love to hear your reflections on this thinking about organisational change!

There’s a lot more to be said about this, but I’ll just say

- we suspect that this is because most change is complex/social, and is poorly served by a programmatic approach
- the ‘three box model’ (see [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy\_redquadrant-the-three-box-model-activity-6747423779552661504-pOiZ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_redquadrant-the-three-box-model-activity-6747423779552661504-pOiZ)) is a brilliant tool to optimise the balance between top-down and bottom-up — because in any traditional organisation, there’s always going to be this kind of balance.

By the way, 95% top-down and 95% bottom-up change were \*so\* disastrous that they didn’t it into the full study — not enough data, as they crashed and burned very early.
