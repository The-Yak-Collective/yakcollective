<h4>Communal Computing’s Many Problems</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0MOHmHJ-0wqxkOOU.jpg" /><figcaption><em>Microscopio de tres cuerpos (source: </em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fdctsevilla/4052593758/in/photostream/"><em>Biblioteca General Antonio Machado</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the devices aren’t designed with communal computing expectations in mind, they’re destined for the landfill.</p><p>In this <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/">next article about communal computing</a> we walk through five problem areas: identity, privacy, security, experience, and ownership.</p><p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/">Communal Computing&#39;s Many Problems</a></p><p>As technologists, we often call these weirdnesses “edge cases.” That’s precisely where we’re wrong: they’re not edge cases, but they’re at the core of how people want to use these devices.</p><p>There are key questions for each of these areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity</strong> — do we know all of the people who are using the device?</li><li><strong>Privacy</strong> — are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access? What about children?</li><li><strong>Security</strong> — are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t? What about biometrics?</li><li><strong>Experience</strong> — what is the contextually appropriate display or next action?</li><li><strong>Ownership</strong> — who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?</li></ul><p>If we don’t reconsider how these devices are designed and built they will keep getting recycled. I hope you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/">find this post helpful</a> in understanding the problems.</p><p>See the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/">first post for the history of how we got here</a>:</p><p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/">Communal Computing</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f9f74087d929" width="1" height="1" alt="">
