<h3>â€˜Freedom dayâ€™ poll now closedâ€Šâ€”â€Šreally interesting toÂ me.</h3><p>See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6823874241377767424/">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6823874241377767424/</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/0*xjDNFlOyAPOWeGLX" /><figcaption>(It absolutely wasnâ€™t â€˜in the UKâ€Šâ€”â€Šthat was dumb of meâ€Šâ€”â€Šit was in Englandâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut you canâ€™t edit poll questions)</figcaption></figure><p>Only a quarter of people celebrating outright, only one in five completely condemning the openingÂ up.</p><p>A clear majority seem somewhere in betweenâ€Šâ€”â€Štheyâ€™re â€˜not going to tear the pants out of itâ€™. And 22 people feeling that they are now more vulnerable and isolated because thereâ€™s no longer a legal requirement for distancing and masks. This is a serious and underrated problem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK has close to the highest tested infection rates in the world, with proportions testing positive suggesting we are very much under-testing. Personally, Iâ€™m guessing the next lockdown will come in about six weeks orÂ so.</p><p>Personally, I hope everyone will continue to err on the side of cautionâ€Šâ€”â€Šmasks, vaccines, and lots and lots of airflowâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhile making the most of living their lives safely. Iâ€™m not going into shops or any indoor setting where people are unmasked.</p><p>What I really appreciated, though, was the civility of the conversationâ€Šâ€”â€Šclearly very strong emotions and opinions, but I donâ€™t think anyone was called names or disrespectful. Thatâ€™s a pretty good signâ€¦Â ðŸ¤ž</p><h3>Look after yourselvesâ€Šâ€”â€Šand, if you can, look after each otherÂ too.</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1b588537780" width="1" height="1" alt="">
