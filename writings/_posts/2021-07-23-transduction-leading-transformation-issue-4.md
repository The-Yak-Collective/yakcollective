### Transduction — leading transformation — Issue #4

Ask me anything!

I’m trying out ‘Racket’ — so you have a chance to ask me about systems | cybernetics | complexity in public | service | sransformation… and anything else you’d like.

👉🏻 Leave a 30-second voicemail here and I’ll reply:

What is Racket? Here’s one I made earlier: [https://racket.com/antlerboy/r9Hbf](https://racket.com/antlerboy/r9Hbf)

This week I had:

- the weird experience of a face-to-face meeting for the first time in… 16 months??
- the fulfilling experience of seeing graduates from a Commissioning Academy present _amazing_ hundred-days plans and show real progress, their powerful critical thinking, and determination
- thoughtful client feedback from a three-year capability support piece which has generated some rich thinking — look for that soon
- Chairing day two of the Public Sector Show with some really inspiring, connected, complexity-aware, loving, productive conversations! (You can still register and see all the sessions until 30 August at [https://publicsectorshow.co.uk/)](https://publicsectorshow.co.uk/))
- A trip to Manchester to help out my old dad, which has been rewarding, tiring, and emotional

Part of my experimenting with racket.com (see above) was thinking about two great questions posed by Indy Neogy:

#### [Which systems theorist had the most impact on their own organisation?](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_which-systems-theorist-had-the-most-impact-activity-6815269415127523328-00Tw/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

So much discussion on this [on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ecologyofsystemsthinking/posts/4113092132103233/ )and on the linkedin link below (which also leads you to the Racket recording)

I find it remarkable that the Probation Service — which is, after all, a pretty important public service — was effectively renationalised on Saturday, after being wrecked by government privatisation since 2013, but that this got, as far as I can see, no coverage in the media🧐…
