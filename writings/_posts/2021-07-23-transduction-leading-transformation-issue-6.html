<h3>Transduction — leading transformation — Issue #6</h3><p>Here’s this week’s collection of my articles, links, and other updates.</p><p>This newsletter is hand-compiled with links that Revue pulls from my tweets (though it doesn’t quite provide the full stream), my blogs — <a href="http://www.chose-path.org,">www.chose-path.org,</a> <a href="http://www.syscoi.com,">www.syscoi.com,</a> <a href="http://www.govtransformation.org,">www.govtransformation.org,</a> and also content at <a href="http://www.publicservicetransformation.org">www.publicservicetransformation.org</a> — and anything I manually pull in. It seems to be a good system. I’d welcome feedback!</p><h3>Top five of the week</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*uLV0HWufyOGMKqEh" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/14/cybernetics-is-not-the-banana/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>Cybernetics is not the banana.

Imagine a chimp in a cage. In this cage is a banana on top of a large shelf, out of reach for the chimp. However, there is also a stick in the cage. Of course, the chimp will manage to get the banana using the stick. Von Foerster said ‘Cybernetics is not the banana’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*x9BOzyjYc4XXyIoy" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.australasianchangedays.com/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>I’m speaking at Australasian Change Days — ‘Honest, Guvnor’ — how to use manipulation, compliance, and lies to drive change’</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.australasianchangedays.com/"><strong>www.australasianchangedays.com</strong></a></p><p>Part of the Change Days… family, I guess? with Change Days events happening ‘in’ Toronto and Berlin this year.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*KvSaL_d1PNn9qvhV" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/15/this-week-i-spoke-at-leanagileuk-on-five-core-practices-for-effective-organisations/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>This week I spoke at #leanagileUK on ‘five core practices’ for effective organisations</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/15/this-week-i-spoke-at-leanagileuk-on-five-core-practices-for-effective-organisations/"><strong>chosen-path.org</strong></a></p><p>Thanks to Matt Turner — and Dinah Turner did this great piece of graphic facilitation.

I got very into Heinz von Foerster videos when writing not the banana; he’s unusually passionate, very Germanic, and gave some interviews at a very advanced age (but still highly coherent), so the overall effect is very striking.
