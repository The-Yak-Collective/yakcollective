[**‘Honest, guv’nor’ how to use change management for evil**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/21/honest-guvnor-how-to-use-change-management-for-evil/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/21/honest-guvnor-how-to-use-change-management-for-evil/)

[**My little freedom day poll: results**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/22/my-little-freedom-day-poll-results/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/22/my-little-freedom-day-poll-results/)

Really interesting to me. Only a quarter of people celebrating outright, only one in five completely condemning the opening up. A clear majority seem somewhere in between — they’re ‘not going to tear the pants out of it’. And 22 people feeling that they are now more vulnerable and isolated…

### Organisational development / transformation

#### [What would you say if I told you customer intimacy was dangerous?](http://www.govtransformation.org/think-piece/what-would-you-say-if-i-told-you-customer-intimacy-was-dangerous/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

 If you want to really satisfy your customers, read on. Most organisations hear ‘listen to what the customer needs’ and say ‘yes! optimise for this!’ They hear ‘transactional efficiency saves money’, and go ‘yes! everything efficient!’ Truth: there are two types of customer service flavours: 1) transactional — customers can reliably specify and find the […]

Tyson Yunkaporta’s podcast:

“Dr David Reser and I talk about our inter-cultural bromance that has grown out of memory science experiments over the last few years, starting with our initial meet-cute nerding out over cranial nerves, 3d printing, dot paintings and Hannibal Lecter. This bromance has survived two culture wars and a recent controversy in which our experimental research paper (comparing the Ancient Greek Memory Palace technique with Aboriginal memorisation techniques) was turned into divisive click-bait for culture warriors.”
