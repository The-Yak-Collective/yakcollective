<p>After ten years of living in SF, I finally made it up to the summit of San Bruno Mountain.</p>

<p>San Bruno Mountain is near the southern border of San Francisco and it separates the city from South San Francisco and Colma. It was a clear day and we had fantastic views from the top – we could a sweeping panorama that included downtown SF, Oakland and easy bay, Mount Diablo, and a good chunk of south bay. The western half of SF and much of Daly City and Colma were shrouded in fog but that just added to the view.</p>

<p>We started from a parking lot halfway up the mountain (at Guadalupe Canyon Parkway and Radio Road) and climbed the Summit Loop Train to the top. It was a nice 30min hike up and started out with a small forest and then wove through a series of valleys and overlooks before reaching the radio towers at the summit where we had spectacular views.</p>

<p>Next time I’ll aim for a clear day where I can see the Pacific side of the peninsula and I also might try hiking the ridge trail all the way east to where it looks over Highway 101.</p>
