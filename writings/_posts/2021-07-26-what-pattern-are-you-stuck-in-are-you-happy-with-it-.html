<p>I learned from doing a podcast interview that:</p><ul><li>I have cultivated a massive tendency to ‘openness’ to information and perspectives — because I know I can get set in my ways (and now I’m set in my ways of being open)</li><li>that I use a set of externalised commitment devices to keep myself consistent and persistent, even though I feel myself to be pretty flaky at times</li><li>that have people around me and make public statements and commitments to make myself ethical, partly because I know I can be well dodgy if I’m not careful!</li></ul><p>(I also learned that I think out loud, in conversation — though I guess I knew that already)</p><p>In other words, I’ve trapped myself in a box that I rather like — a box of learning and listening and trying to be decent.</p><p>This box will give me blindsides, of course — times when I’m not ethical or open, which I <em>really</em> can’t see because my behaviour still fits, somehow, with the people I have around me.</p><p>But, over time, we build up an identity, a belief that ‘I’m like this’, and often this is as much scaffolding around us as it is something internal.</p><p>So it was amusing to see this come up in my timeline about a man who is so committed to routine and his farm and the land that he’s had the same meal every day for ten years.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/16/experience-ive-had-the-same-supper-for-10-years">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/16/experience-ive-had-the-same-supper-for-10-years</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/908/0*9Ygu-FAVcr2tB45n" /></figure><h3>What have you created a commitment to in your life?
