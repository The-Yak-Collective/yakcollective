‘Clarity is kindness’ says Brene Brown. So here’s an easy way to generate [#clarity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=clarity&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6807558639147200512) — what’s your favourite way to do it?

And I’ve seen lack of clarity create organisational problems more often than perhaps anything else.

Don’t get me wrong — this isn’t imposing clarity on complexity, attempts to define and control, limits, fake certainty.

This is about getting clear about relationships, expectations, commitments — how we will work together, given what we know and our understanding of the situation.

In fact, because ‘command-and-control’ and ‘micro management’ get a bad name — for good reasons — good people are often afraid to offer clarity. And lack of clarity is unkind, it leads to failure and bad working relationships.

CPORT is useful acronym to generate TASK clarity:  
\> Context — what do we know? what are the limits of the work?  
\> Purpose — why are you doing this task?  
\> Outcome — what does a good result look like?  
\> Resources — what can you call upon to do the work?  
\> Time — what is critical about when this needs to be done?
