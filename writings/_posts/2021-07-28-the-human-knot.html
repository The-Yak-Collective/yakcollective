<h3>What does this remind you of?</h3><p>(It’s not kinky or weird — I promise)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*KSokmFFKLTYYUyuKonA5-Q.png" /><figcaption>I love these images from wikihow for it- brilliant and hilarious</figcaption></figure><p>This is a neat little exercise to get people thinking — in pre- or hopefully post-pandemic times…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*-6Zjfr_LqYHwmss-oMrR_w.png" /></figure><p>All you need to do is to get people into groups of at least six to eight (more is ok) and have everyone hand grasp one other hand in a complex way across the whole group — then, without letting go of hands, they have to untangle. Gently, of course.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*D5L86fm4zeR9zLTSBH6qSw.png" /></figure><p>When one team achieves it, they can go and advise the other teams (which won’t help).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*q3lsiLKz8ZGn4AXs2OH1Vg.png" /></figure><p>The debrief is the interesting part:<br> <br> — It’s uncomfortable — closer, more challenging, nervous laughter<br> — sometimes got worse before it got better<br> — sometimes got better before it got worse<br> — all perspectives needed<br> — all connected<br> — when it got better in one place it might have got worse in another<br> — you have to be a good sport<br> — you have to trust each other<br> — even one person really resisting blocks the whole system<br> — there’s no ‘god’s eye view’ — someone on a stepladder couldn’t have given instructions to make it better<br> — the experts who’ve done it elsewhere didn’t really help (though there seem to be some useful rules of thumb)<br> — some people end up facing out, some facing in<br> — it’s possible to cheat<br> <br>I find this a brilliant exercise for groups of senior leaders trying to work together. It’s a lot deeper than it might appear on the surface.</p><h3>Why is it so useful, do you think?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*WgQNX8j5XEi8flnR0jgXXA.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7793c971953c" width="1" height="1" alt="">
