I am taking a summer break from this newsletter through August, starting today.[1](#footnote-1) Regular programming will resume in the first week of September.

For paying subscribers, billing will be paused until I hit the resume button. Your next bill date will be pushed out appropriately. If you have 12 days left on a monthly subscription right now, youâ€™ll still have 12 days left when I resume. If you have 289 days left on an annual subscription, youâ€™ll still have 289 days.

Youâ€™ll still have access to the [archives](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) as usual of course, so you can catch up on stuff you might have missed.

Going forward, I will likely be taking a couple of such breaks per year, with billing paused. Itâ€™s partly a function of varying load on other fronts, and partly a somewhat predictable seasonal personal energy pattern thing. The rough plan is to take a few weeks off in August and February, and tweak it as necessary for load balancing, for as long as I continue writing this newsletter.

Have a great rest of your summer, and see you in September!
