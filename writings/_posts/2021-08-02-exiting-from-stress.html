<p>It’s often *after* the stress that the problems kick in.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*CXzX4_-9sTxzER7W" /></figure><p><strong>How do we exit from stress gracefully?</strong></p><p>If you’ve ever been to a busy restaurant at 11pm on a Saturday and marvelled at the fluid teamwork (with occasional flare-ups that are instantly resolved), the speed, the accuracy, the effectiveness of the very low-paid staff… then gone back at 3pm on a quiet Thursday and seen everything fall apart… you know what I mean.</p><p>At our regular Friday RedQuadrant consultant get-together recently, the topic was expertly raised of ‘floundering’. Not a breakdown, not a burnout, just someone who seems to be weakly waving but is really drowning under it all.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*pta6O4tAK1QsfMrG" /></figure><p>And very, very little of the ‘resilience’ literature describes this phase.</p><p>It helps you to prepare for and surf the stress, and talks about the good times, self-care, and looking after yourself. It doesn’t talk about the flatness, the inability to engage and enjoy when things get quiet.</p><p>But we have to look at the post-trauma literature to really see the impacts — the hyper-alertness, the slow-motion breakdown, loss of motivation, listlessness.</p><p>Over the next few months — never mind when the next lockdowns come — we need to be prepared for this as well as the long-lasting effects of COVID-19 and lockdown.</p><p>What’s your top tip for exiting from stress gracefully?</p><p>What shall we do when the immediate storm is over, but we’re just not quite right?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*5WHVWgktItmewtmd" /></figure><p><strong>#resilience</strong> <strong>#mentalhealth</strong> <strong>#stress</strong> <strong>#trauma</strong> <strong>#covidー19</strong> <strong>#humanresources</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c6753d3b912f" width="1" height="1" alt="">
