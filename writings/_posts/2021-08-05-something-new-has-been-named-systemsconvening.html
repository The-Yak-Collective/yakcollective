<h3>Do you know systems conveners? Are you one?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6Un5QbAeq96dEI_8" /></figure><p>The new book from Bev and Etienne Wenger-Trayner starts:</p><p>“You may not have heard about them; what they do is rarely in their job description. You may not even be aware of what they do; they tend to act as enablers rather than taking credit or seeking the spotlight. But they are here — working on sustainable change, across challenging silos, in complex social landscapes, amid changing circumstances. We call them systems conveners.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PkEVOVbgvDvMUj4Q" /></figure><p>Let me be clear: such people have been around forever. But it takes a special kind of expertise to identify the thing and, as they say, shine a light on it.</p><p>As the person who named communities of practice, and associated concepts like legitimate peripheral participant, Etienne Wenger-Trayner is uniquely good at this; many of the interviewees have been in tears of gratitude at being recognised.</p><p>Systems conveners are deeply embedded and yet can see new possibilities.</p><ul><li>They are passionate about change yet enabling and facilitative and creative. They challenge the current reality, yet use all tools including existing boundaries and power to achieve their goals.</li><li>They’re impatient to make a difference yet patient in their actions, knowing that real embedded change takes time. They have clarity of vision but embrace the creativity of the process.</li></ul><p>At heart, they know their work — and they get on with it.</p><p>___</p><p>And yes, we’re aware of the likely problem now this thing has been named. There will, inevitably, be some or all of: funding streams; short courses; accreditation; conferences; self-appointed LinkedIn titles; and critiques and over-simplifications. Enthusiasts gonna enthuse, popularisers gonna oversimplify, gooroos gonna gooroo, and curmudgeons gonna grump.</p><p>There’s a bit on this in the book. Every step toward legibility risks draining the essence, every codification risks destroying knowledge, every extension is also an amputation.</p><p>But this greebling — this new possibility we can now be aware of — is valuable in itself.</p><p>And the true systems conveners will carry on, making the difference — a little bit buoyed up, a little bit stronger, and with this book as a handbook for them to continue to engage in their context, to their purpose.</p><p>___</p><p>These are real stories about people and their work — a landscape view of work at diverse scales, scopes, and missions which builds a theory of practice from practice.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/688/0*aKQfIz9V0tjsdp3E" /></figure><p>Thanks to the generosity of the sponsoring organisations — the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Centre for Public Impact</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">The Lankellychase Foundation</a>, The RSA and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Beverly Wenger-Trayner</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Etienne Wenger-Trayner</a> themselves — the book is FREE for download now, and there is a launch webinar on September 2.</p><h3>Register for the launch webinar on 2 September: <a href="https://bit.ly/SCBookLaunch">https://bit.ly/SCBookLaunch</a></h3><h3>Download the book and join the community: <a href="https://bit.ly/SystemsConvening">https://bit.ly/SystemsConvening</a></h3><p>___</p><p>In a world of flaneurs, fakes, floaters and frauds (present company broadly included 😉) — these people are doing the work, and this book lets us learn from them.</p><p>pdf of excerpts and links: <a href="https://chosenpath.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/excerpts-and-links-systems-convening-wenger-trayner.pdf">excerpts-and-links- Systems Convening — Wenger-TraynerDownload</a></p><p><strong>#leadership</strong> <strong>#change</strong> <strong>#innovation</strong> <strong>#systemsconvening</strong> <strong>#socialjustice</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f7c468315be3" width="1" height="1" alt="">
