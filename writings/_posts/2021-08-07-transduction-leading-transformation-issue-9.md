The big thing I shared this week was the new #systemscovening book from Bev and Etienne Wenger-Trayner. I’m proud to have been involved in a sort of sounding board for the development of the book.

**Register for the launch webinar on 2 September:** [**https://bit.ly/SCBookLaunch**](https://bit.ly/SCBookLaunch)

**Download the book and join the community:** [**https://bit.ly/SystemsConvening**](https://bit.ly/SystemsConvening)

It is fascinating that a real proportion of the responses to this launch have been on the cynical side (something I’m prone to myself!) — and, as I predicted, from [all quadrants of the ‘thinking threats’ grid](https://chosen-path.org/2021/01/18/are-you-a-naive-enthusiast-an-oversimplifying-populariser-a-gooroo-or-a-curmudgeon/).

I look forward to further discussions on this…

(And for more on my thinking on systems change and systems leadership, see [here](https://chosen-path.org/2021/06/21/making-sense-of-systems-change-and-systems-leadership/))

### Top phive of the week

Do you know systems conveners? Are you one?

The new book from Bev and Etienne Wenger-Trayner starts: “You may not have heard about them; what they do is rarely in their job description. You may not even be aware of what they do; they tend to act as enablers rather than taking credit or seeking …

And comments on how this will be received!

[**Exiting from stress**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/08/02/exiting-from-stress/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2021/08/02/exiting-from-stress/)

It’s often \*after\* the stress that the problems kick in. How do we exit from stress gracefully? If you’ve ever been to a busy restaurant at 11pm on a Saturday and marvelled at the fluid teamwork (with occasional flare-ups that are instantly resolved), the speed, the accuracy, the effectiveness of the very low-paid staff… then …
