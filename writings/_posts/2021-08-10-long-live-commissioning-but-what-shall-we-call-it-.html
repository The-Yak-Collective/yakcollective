<p>What do you call an approach that moves <strong>#publicservices</strong></p><p>from</p><ul><li>‘spending money on services to meet needs’</li></ul><p>to</p><ul><li>‘intervening and learning in the complex systems that actually shape our lives’?</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/0*92XLwfMx0A5-psDc" /><figcaption>Long live commissioning</figcaption></figure><p>The former sees ‘services’ as the whole universe, brought into being by our public service cash.</p><p>The latter sees that people are busy living their lives and that funding is just part of the influence we can have on citizen and community outcomes.</p><p>The word we’re stuck with, like it or not, is <strong>#commissioning</strong>.</p><p>It’s been five months since I last wrote ‘it ain’t dead!’ (I checked). And I have to keep saying it.</p><p>Yet because commissioning covers that (still vital) process of deciding which services (in-house, outsourced, third sector) are funded and which are not, it still gets bracketed with procurement, outsourcing, and contract management.</p><p>It’s much more than that, and since 2011 we’ve been working to show how it much more deserves to be part of <strong>#systemschange</strong> <strong>#systemsleadership</strong> and what’s now called <strong>#humanlearningsystems</strong></p><p>My latest piece in the Municipal Journal is at <a href="https://www.themj.co.uk/Long-live-commissioning-/221192">https://www.themj.co.uk/Long-live-commissioning-/221192</a></p><p><strong>How would you try to get this message across?
