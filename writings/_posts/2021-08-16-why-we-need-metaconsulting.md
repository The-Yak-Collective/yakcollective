### Have you ever seen #consultants deliver the right thing — in the wrong time and place? Go wrong because they were trying to impose their model, not adapt to circumstances?

Many consultancies are one-trick ponies, and that kinda works. They do one thing and they do it well, giving people variants of the same approach. The less variance you offer, the more money you can make. Especially with well-informed clients, stuff gets done.

Where it doesn’t work is when the context isn’t appropriate.

It doesn’t work when you try to force a model which is out of context.

And it doesn’t work in #complexity.

Today is the last week to sign up to the autumn cohorts of the RedQuadrant tool shed. It’s the virtual place where all of our methods, approaches, tools, template, practices and theories are stored.

And we share it with you — so you can build your own tool box to be a good fit for the job at hand.

The tool shed includes:

- twice-monthly small group shared learning sessions with me
- access to our full ‘tool shed’ online
- access to an updated version of our core learning programme, Leading #Transformation — 24 modules with videos, slides, transcripts, additional tools, articles, links

Contents of the core learning programme (only a part of the tool shed):
