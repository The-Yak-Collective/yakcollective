<h3>Speaking gigs — what do you think?</h3><h3>Do you have tips how to get the best results out of them?</h3><p>My mission seems to be to spread the good-humoured word about systems | cybernetics | complexity.</p><p>I wanted to change the world by transforming consultancy and transforming public services, and, well, in the words of Tesla about the ‘self-driving’ myth — ‘the real world turns out to be a lot more detailed’. So that’s on the long-term list!</p><p>I really appreciate speaking opportunities and tend to take most of them, but it’s very hard to evaluate impact: for me or the participants.</p><p>I’ve got a few coming up and so I’m preparing. I want to create a good experience and really interest and engage participants. And, as I make my money from consultancy and teaching and sharing, I want people to remember me if they are looking for support.</p><p>Of course, what I always get from these gigs is a chance to refine and sort my thinking, and a chance to listen to and network with some amazing speakers and participants — just take a look at the speaker lists to see!</p><p>Here’s what I have for the Autumn:</p><h3>&gt; The RedQuadrant tool shed</h3><p>New cohorts launching soon: my support and tool shed for your coaching / consulting / facilitation</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/RQtoolshedshownandtell">http://bit.ly/RQtoolshedshownandtell</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/618/0*79RwRp0h_f00obtJ" /></figure><p>&gt; Systems Convening book launch webinar September 2</p><p>(I’m only speaking for about two minutes at this, to be fair — but it’s a good opportunity to give another plug for what I think is an important book)</p><p><a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/07/systems-convening-book-launch-webinar/">https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/07/systems-convening-book-launch-webinar/</a></p><h3>&gt; Australasian Change Days September 9–11</h3><p>Sarah Glenister and team have again put together an event which is both an outstanding conference and a great experience of being in community.
