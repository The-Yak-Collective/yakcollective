<p>Can we really say that people progress through different levels of ability to deal with #complexity across their life?</p><p>And that we can measure and identify what level people are at? Predict how they’ll develop? And select and promote people based on that?</p><p>Or, as Nora Bateson said when she began the tango, will it be coopted to be just another form of kyriarchical privilege?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kTOlhXuUJMWXoVwS" /></figure><p>Nora put it more succinctly:</p><p>Stage theory…</p><p>Is BS.</p><p>Always was.</p><p>And it is colonial as hell.</p><p>Sorry, but that has got to go.</p><p>So, this has provoked a LOT of debate.</p><p>Stage theories cover things like:</p><ul><li>childhood development: all basically begun by Piaget</li></ul><p>(Nora says his research assistants documented him deliberately ignoring context in naming and evaluating ‘levels’)</p><ul><li>#adultdevelopment: that we develop through different distinct phases post-childhood, in our ability to comprehend complexity, in our moral frameworks and in our sensemaking and logic of action</li></ul><p>Many have worked in this space of ‘#verticaldevelopment’ (as distinct from normal skills training), from Jaques to Cook-Greuter, Kegan to Torbert, Graves to Wilber etc.</p><p>This is sometimes applied at an organisational level too.</p><ul><li>world development: from Vico to Hegel and Marx to ‘the end of history’ etc</li></ul><p>And, it’s true, that as soon as we say ‘this stage is distinct from that’ and ‘this is superior from that’ (however much we say ‘the Wizard level /transcends and includes/ the Diplomat level or whatever), we are doing that core colonialist thing of placing one thing about the other.</p><p>We are most likely doing it from the perspective of some hierarchy as well, whether privilege or dominance or esteem or radical critical hierarchies, too.</p><p>And with hindsight, judgement, our current state lense.</p><p>The best of these theories recognise it’s not strict boundaries but ragged transitions, dependent on circumstances. And that ‘developed’ does not mean ‘better’.</p><p>We know that there *is* something that it is like to look back and say ‘I used to reason differently then, and now I understand that perspective, but I seem to have a broader understanding now’.</p><p>It certainly doesn’t seem to be ‘only’ stage progress. So much depends on context and state. And is saying ‘stage theory is BS’ also presenting a stage theory?</p><p>So — do you think there’s value in these ‘stage theories’, or only danger?</p><p>#leadership #culture</p><p>Here are some links:</p><p>Nora’s original tweet</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NoraBateson/status/1425142926254956550">https://twitter.com/NoraBateson/status/1425142926254956550</a></p><p>And Facebook post</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/564455859/posts/10159038460440860/?d=n">https://www.facebook.com/564455859/posts/10159038460440860/?d=n</a></p><p>A partial response from one of the Hanzi Freinacht people</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1199720657209567&amp;id=100015149321507">https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1199720657209567&amp;id=100015149321507</a></p><p>(The Collective Journey — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_images-for-the-collective-journey-activity-6831556064480235520-aegq">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_images-for-the-collective-journey-activity-6831556064480235520-aegq</a> — by the way, is a stage theory)</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=433151f4ef47" width="1" height="1" alt="">
