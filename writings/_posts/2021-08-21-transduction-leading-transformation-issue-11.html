<br> Religious rituals are associated with health benefits, potentially produced via social bonding. It is unknown whether secular rituals similarly increase social bonding. We conducted a field study with individuals who celebrate secular rituals at Sunday Assemblies and compared them with participants attending Christian rituals. We assessed levels of social bonding and affect before and after the rituals. Results showed the increase in social bonding taking place in secular rituals is comparable to religious rituals. We also found that both sets of rituals increased positive affect and decreased negative affect, and that the change in positive affect predicted the change in social bonding observed. Together these results suggest that secular rituals might play a similar role to religious ones in fostering feelings of social connection and boosting positive affect.</p><h4><a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/08/16/2021-08-09-normal-accidents-high-reliability-wicked-messes-coevolving-innovations/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">2021/08/09 Normal Accidents, High Reliability, Wicked Messes | Coevolving Innovations</a></h4><p><a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/08/16/2021-08-09-normal-accidents-high-reliability-wicked-messes-coevolving-innovations/">stream.syscoi.com</a></p><p>Have we learned from brushes with disaster, or have we become complacent about complexities in everyday life?
