Commissioning is dead. So why the hell won’t it go away? In fact, this piece is in a long tradition of articles headlined ‘Commissioning is dead, long live commissioning’, right back to 2012 (and commissioning was only really introduced in its modern form in about 2010). The answer […]

Can we really say that people progress through different levels of ability to deal with #complexity across their life? And that we can measure and identify what level people are at? Predict how they’ll develop? And select and promote people based on that? Or, as Nora Bateson said when she began the tango, will it …

Have you ever seen #consultants deliver the right thing — in the wrong time and place? Go wrong because they were trying to impose their model, not adapt to circumstances? Many consultancies are one-trick ponies, and that kinda works. They do one thing and they do it well, giving people variants of the same approach. The less …

[**United on Sunday: The effects of secular rituals on social bonding and affect**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0242546&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffer8c399&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com) ** — ** [**journals.plos.org**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242546&utm_content=buffer8c399&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)   
 Religious rituals are associated with health benefits, potentially produced via social bonding. It is unknown whether secular rituals similarly increase social bonding. We conducted a field study with individuals who celebrate secular rituals at Sunday Assemblies and compared them with participants attending Christian rituals. We assessed levels of social bonding and affect before and after the rituals. Results showed the increase in social bonding taking place in secular rituals is comparable to religious rituals. We also found that both sets of rituals increased positive affect and decreased negative affect, and that the change in positive affect predicted the change in social bonding observed. Together these results suggest that secular rituals might play a similar role to religious ones in fostering feelings of social connection and boosting positive affect.
