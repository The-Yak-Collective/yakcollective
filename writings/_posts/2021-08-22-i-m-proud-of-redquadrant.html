<h3>I try to make these posts interesting, challenging, accessible. But today I’m just going to be proud of my company for a minute here.</h3><p><strong>What’s your big achievement at the moment?</strong></p><p>Mine is that we set up in public services consultancy in 2009, just as the good times turned into full-blown austerity.</p><p>We survived <em>that</em>, we survived the “Brexit” dry-up in the second half of 2016 (almost no new work for six months — just as we launched the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">The Public Service Transformation Academy</a> — a not-for-profit social enterprise, with partners).</p><p>We survived COVID-19 (to date, anyway) — that was a really tough one, we had to let some people go (and the office). We might even survive the continuing austerity and “Brexit” itself!</p><p>And, ten years after qualifying for a cross-<strong>#publicsector</strong> <strong>#procurement</strong> framework for the first time, we’ve continued uninterrupted on the ESPO framework.</p><p>What’s that? Well, it means any public service in the UK (and charities too) can procure our services in a legal and compliant way, directly or in a mini-competition.</p><p>And we did *well*! We got on a record 17 ‘lots’:</p><p><strong>We received first or second placing amongst bidders for:</strong></p><p>• Revenues and Benefits</p><p>• Public <strong>#healthcare</strong></p><p>• General Finance</p><p>• Children’s <strong>#SocialCare</strong></p><p>• Strategic <strong>#IT</strong></p><p>• Housing and Housing Support</p><p>• Strategic <strong>#Projects</strong></p><p>• Community Research and Engagement</p><p><strong>Top five placings for:</strong></p><p>• Business Services</p><p>• Adult Social Care</p><p>• Regeneration and Regional Development</p><p>• Marketing, Communications and PR</p><p>• Leisure, Culture and Tourism (including Library Services)</p><p><strong>AND we also qualified with high scores for:</strong></p><p>• Procurement</p><p>• Highways, Traffic and Transport</p><p>• Environmental and Sustainability</p><p>• Waste and Recycling</p><p><strong>This *ain’t* the gravy train.</strong></p><p>We still have to bid, most likely competitively, for every piece of work. And then actually deliver, in tough times in critical services.</p><p>But that’s the challenge we set ourselves up for!</p><p><strong>What are you proud of today?</strong></p><p>All our frameworks are shared at:</p><p><a href="http://www.redquadrant.com/frameworks">www.redquadrant.com/frameworks</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/606/0*vlOUj-6pI_RAUIf4" /><figcaption><a href="https://a478cfd1-b9d7-40a8-9cb4-7b493c1cd390.filesusr.com/ugd/12b1f3_456dca8af5fe45c0b839c55a03511c25.pdf">https://a478cfd1-b9d7-40a8-9cb4-7b493c1cd390.filesusr.com/ugd/12b1f3_456dca8af5fe45c0b839c55a03511c25.pdf</a></figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ab5ce04b7cb7" width="1" height="1" alt="">
