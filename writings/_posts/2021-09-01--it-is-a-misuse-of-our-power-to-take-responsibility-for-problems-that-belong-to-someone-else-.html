<p>Today I want to invite you to meditate on two quotes:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*d2AHUnt13vlilLRt" /></figure><p>“It is a misuse of our power to take responsibility for problems that belong to someone else.”</p><p>“It’s a cry out against help, against charity, against philanthropy — all forms of colonialism”</p><p>These are both from Peter Block, who wrote Flawless Consulting, Community: the structure of belonging, and many more. He’s a bit of a hero to me because of his deep thinking on what it means to intervene in complex systems… and he’s not a raving libertarian or an ungrounded realist.</p><p>Yet I find that these two quotes deeply challenge some of our most fundamental assumptions. What do they say to you?</p><p>Please comment on the lively LinkedIn discussion at:</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_a-cry-against-help-peter-block-activity-6838730657401835520-TrHm/">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_a-cry-against-help-peter-block-activity-6838730657401835520-TrHm/</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a39dce528657" width="1" height="1" alt="">
