First time in eighteen months thanks to the pandemic and related business and unrelated family issues :-)

And it is rather wonderful. I wholly recommend it!

Fascinating to see all the wannabe Instagram Influencers and their partners (long-suffering or taking turns) move from coveted rock to ankle-deep-in-the-sea shot, making the same poses then moving on. And here I am talking about it o. #socialmedia. With hashtags, no less.

I have a few things to do so I might pop up this week. But I might not :-)

Have a great week!
