<p><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v19">Adam named all the animal species</a>, according to some readings, about 5782 years ago. And the great <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kearns/pervasive-and-ubiquitous-identity">David Kearns wrote about pervasive and ubiquitous identity back in 2013</a>. Nine years later the explosive growth of ubicomp continues to spew sensing, thought, controls and talk into our buildings, cars, homes, medical devices, energy grids, and everything else.  </p>



<p>&#8220;Digital Identity&#8221; started off as managing usernames and passwords on timesharing mainframes in the 1960s. Decentralization of computing means brings <a href="https://wider.team/2021/06/21/we-need-to-talk-ux-for-identity-of-things-conversations/">identity conversations</a> with it, so they pervade our physical world as much as our virtual ones. Pervasive identity is a connective tissue helping us trust what we experience (or distrust it), delegate control to our agents and devices, and form meaningful consent. </p>



<p>When you&#8217;re building or healing the metaverse this year, high assurance identity is a way to bridge relationships in a much larger ecosystem of connections. It&#8217;s a way to futureproof (a little) today&#8217;s investments and to create agility to seize short term opportunities, and resilience against short term shocks. It&#8217;s become a way to scale interop among countries and across corporate lock-in. </p>



<p>Pervasive identity is a very old idea that&#8217;s becoming just plain identity. </p>



<p>P.S. If your device&#8217;s identity is obsolete, frail, or broken, does it really exist? </p>
