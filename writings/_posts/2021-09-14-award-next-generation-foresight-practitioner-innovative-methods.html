<p>I’m excited and honored to announce that I’ve won an award: the Next Generation Foresight Practitioners Special Award for Innovative Methods.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the awards and my fellow awardees at: <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/2021-awards/" title="https://nextgenforesight.org/2021-awards/">https://nextgenforesight.org/2021-awards/</a></p>

<p>I’m looking forward meeting the other 2021 fellows as well as the broader NGFP community. My application was heavily tied to games and I’m excited to see which other foresight folks are involving games in their practices. I’ll also be adding new features on to Story Synth to make it more powerful for foresight exercises.</p>

<p>I’ll be sure to share what I learn here, as well as updates on any new collaborations!</p>
