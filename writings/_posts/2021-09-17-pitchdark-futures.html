<p><em>This research note is part of the <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/subscribe?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=41469296">Clockless Clock</a> book project.</em></p><p>The term <em>grimdark, </em>and its rather anemic and hapless proposed foil <em>hopepunk, </em>have gained currency for classes of futures defined by gloomy apocalyptic visions and progressive, optimistic ones respectively. The term grimdark is a reference to a memeplex associated with the Warhammer 40k game.&#8230;</p>
