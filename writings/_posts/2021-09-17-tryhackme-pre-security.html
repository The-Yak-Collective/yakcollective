<h1 id="the-file-system">The File System</h1>
<p>NTFS stands for the “New Technology File System”. <em>Very</em> old versions of Windows NT (<em>before</em> FAT32) used HPFS (the “High Performance File System”).</p>
<p>NTFS actually natively supports file-level encryption via EFS (“Encryption File System”).</p>
<p>NTFS is actually a forking file system like HFS. Microsoft calls these forks “alternate data streams” (ADS), and there is always at least one stream (called $DATA) that holds the actual file contents. (ADS is, for example, used to store the “mark of the web”.) While the File Explorer doesn’t display ADS stream information, it can be accessed from Powershell.</p>
<p>Windows permissions for folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read - Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders</li>
<li>Write - Permits adding of files and subfolders</li>
<li>Read &amp; Execute - Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files; inherited by files and folders</li>
<li>List Folder Contents - Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files; inherited by folders only</li>
<li>Modify - Permits reading and writing of files and subfolders; allows deletion of the folder</li>
<li>Full Control - Permits reading, writing, changing, and deleting of files and subfolders</li>
</ul>
