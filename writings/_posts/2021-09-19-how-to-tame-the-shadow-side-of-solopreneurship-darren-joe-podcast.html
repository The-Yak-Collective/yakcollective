<p>“You can’t study or learn your way into a new identity” &#8211; I love this quote from Darren Joe.  </p>



<p>He’s been thinking about carving a different path from 2003 to 2004 when he graduated college.  This was before Tim Ferriss&#8217; 4-Hour Workweek and before becoming a digital nomad was a thing.  I asked him what his inspirations were and he wasn&#8217;t quite sure.  He just always had a natural drive to be independent and do his own thing.  </p>



<p>He recently published a book titled The Fail-Safe Entrepreneur.  In it, he argues that almost all solopreneurs strive for three things: Freedom, Adventure, and Meaning.  I definitely agree.  However, he says many fail to reach these aims because they ignore the shadow side of this path.  He details four things &#8211; FAIL: Failure, anxiety, instability, loneliness.</p>

<p>We explore many things in this conversation including:</p>



<ul><li>Grappling with the achiever identity</li><li>Longing for independence and freedom</li><li>Parental approval</li><li>Building Community</li><li>Experiments</li><li>Defining success</li></ul>
