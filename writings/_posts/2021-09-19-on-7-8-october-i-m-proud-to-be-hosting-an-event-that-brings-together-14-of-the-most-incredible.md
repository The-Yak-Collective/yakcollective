### On 7â€“8 October Iâ€™m proud to be hosting an event that brings together 14 of the most incredible thinkersâ€Šâ€”â€Šwell, 13 and myself ðŸ˜Š

This is going to be an engaging event, not a carousel of powerpoints, weâ€™ll be learning together.

I have two brilliant offers I can share as conference convener:

**ONEâ€Šâ€”â€Šof everyone who likes and comments on this post at** [**https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy\_conscious-organisation-activity-6845607854129471488-fVYp,**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_conscious-organisation-activity-6845607854129471488-fVYp,) **I will randomly select THREE people to get free tickets to the event**

**TWOâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI can offer everyone in my network a 50% discountâ€Šâ€”â€Šjust use the code CONS50**

**The link:** [**https://consciousorg.net/**](https://consciousorg.net/)

\_\_\_

We have the most incredible range; **#futurism** , **#artificialintelligence** experts, systems changers, Daoists, soul coaches, writers on organic organisation, mature masculinity, what being human means, and so much more

The quality of our speakers kind of speaks for itself:

At least three of these folks have their own Wikipedia page!

AND they are down-to-earth, practical, and theyâ€™re coming to \*engage\* in discussion and to work together to support growing consciousness.

So join us on 7â€“8 October from 9:30am EST to explore together.

You may find answers. Or better questions ðŸ˜Š
