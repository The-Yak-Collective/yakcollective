<p>I seem to be developing a fragmentary set of ideas around the philosophy of AI that may well turn into another serialized project for this newsletter. The explorations started with <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/subscribe?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=41729873">Superhistory, Not Superintelligence</a>. I don&#8217;t yet have a clear idea of what the larger project should be, but I want to share a note today on an idea I call Goalposts-complete&#8230;</p>
