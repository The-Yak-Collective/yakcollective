<p>I&#8217;m going to set aside my longer serialized projects for the next month or so. There&#8217;s  too much random disruption happening in my life to work on them, so I&#8217;m going to do a bunch of one-off exploratory pieces on miscellaneous themes that have been on my mind. One such theme is robots. </p><p>The reason robots are on my mind is not because Amazon has released &#8230;</p>
