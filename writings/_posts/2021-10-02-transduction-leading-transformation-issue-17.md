This isn’t (as Clayton Christensen talked about when on payroll) transforming consulting; this is good old-fashioned … [Continue reading McKinsey and the capacity of business for evil →](https://chosen-path.org/2021/10/01/mckinsey-and-the-capacity-of-business-for-evil/)

We \*could\* do medicine as if the point was patients’ health, but that would be a hassle. We’d have to coordinate with the other department, and you know what THEY are like. Obviously management would create a ton of extra paperwork for it, too.

By 1920, the network of interurbans (electrified tramways) in the US was so dense that a determined commuter could theoretically hop interlinked streetcars from Waterville, Maine, to Sheboygan, Wisconsin — a journey of 1,000 miles — exclusively by electric trolley.

The panel discussion chaired by Jackie Ashley, renowned journalist and broadcaster, will discuss why so many PPE-ists end up in leadership positions and why the degree is described as a ‘passport to power’. We will also debate whether this is the degree that runs or ruins countries and institutions. This will be a wide-reaching discussion that will look beyond PPE to other degrees that have shaped many important people and moments in our lifetime. Joining Jackie Ashley on the panel will be Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, Professor Will Davies, The Gabriele Taylor Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy, and Aisha Washington, Director of Operations at Get Further and Venture Partner at Ark.

 Uber and Lyft’s pitch was always that they’d reduce congestion, emissions, car ownership and the total costs that cars impose on society. A new paper shows that the complete opposite has happened — taking an Uber costs society ~60% more than your own car.

 This is deeply disappointing. We can only build a better politics and a fairer country with a fairer electoral system. We will keep working with the many in the Labour Party and across all parties who want to see a fairer electoral system.
