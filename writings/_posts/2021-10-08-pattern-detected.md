What if Netflix was a military contractor?

What if mercenaries had to deal with all of the systems that gig workers are required to comply with?

How does detection of patterns (and randomness) impact military planning as machine learning and compute starts to become commodified?

Should you keep a d20 on you at all times to aid in randomization of my movements?

I recently published a short sci-fi story (with an article talking through the concepts) with the Army Mad Scientist blog that touch on these questions:

[358. Pattern Detected! Masking by Injecting Randomness | Mad Scientist Laboratory](https://madsciblog.tradoc.army.mil/358-pattern-detected-masking-by-injecting-randomness/)

The accompanying article dives into what it means for militaries that will have their tactics and strategies analyzed by increasingly sophisticated machine learning systems for predicting behavior.

It is a continuation of a talk I did around using [randomness to remove bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s963moEQv4E&list=PLTR1CgetbclHfZvNAR8BTCpA5Hz9qFxqf&index=18):

And a previous article touching on [randomness as a way to ideate with crazy eights](https://uxdesign.cc/honing-crazy-eights-with-randomness-1c8100b94824):

[Honing Crazy Eights with randomness](https://uxdesign.cc/honing-crazy-eights-with-randomness-1c8100b94824)

How do you incorporate randomness in your day-to-day?
