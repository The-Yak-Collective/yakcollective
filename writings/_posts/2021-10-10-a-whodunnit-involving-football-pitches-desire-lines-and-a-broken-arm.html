<p>Here’s a puzzle for you.</p><p>In a district council we worked with, there was a new housing estate nicely situated near to the commuter train station.</p><p>There were a few council-maintained football pitches in the way (part of a leafy park which was a big attraction for home-owners), but the council had the developers build a new and pleasant footpath around the edges.</p><p>It quickly became clear, however, that the ‘desire path’ for the commuters to the station was directly across two of the pitches, carving out unpleasant ruts.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/868/1*XCF1yiUVyIKGfCYL7e3_8g.png" /></figure><p>The sports clubs started to complain, it looked a mess, and the council even got a few letters from commuters aggrieved that their shoes had got muddy.</p><p>So what do you think they did?</p><p>&gt;&gt; There’s a ‘wrong answer’ that they persisted with some time.</p><p>(Hint: it involved a broken arm and something threatening to sue).</p><p>&gt;&gt; And a ‘better answer’ after a lot of thinking and engagement with the local people (which we assisted with)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*mRo8LB0hmMIdk1dDg5QsgQ.png" /></figure><p>It’s useful to think of ‘customer demand’ — people’s natural desire to meet their purposes — as being like water: you have to expect that it will flow following natural routes.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*FgJCesDtFPr0OcEv7zFDfw.png" /></figure><p>You have to be realistic about where the demand actually is going, and take decisive action about that — if you’re close off routes, do it decisively and early in a way that works — otherwise, deal with the reality.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*S-CMv_DFckcU5Ze2KziRxg.png" /></figure><p>I’d love to hear your answers!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*p-wenoyKXA0sZOn_mLzRmw.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=16e7657f3b6" width="1" height="1" alt="">
