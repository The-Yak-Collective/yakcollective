If a voice platform like Alexa or Google Home Hub doesn’t prioritize communal computing, how should skill developers build for everyone in the home and office?

In this [recent article with Opus Research](https://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2021/10/14/why-voice-platforms-need-to-make-foundational-changes-to-allow-multi-user-skills/), I give advice for skill developers to make their skills more communal and the case for platforms to be better adapted to everyone that could use it:

[Why Voice Platforms Need to Make Foundational Changes to Allow Multi-User Skills](https://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2021/10/14/why-voice-platforms-need-to-make-foundational-changes-to-allow-multi-user-skills/)

I give four key pieces of advice for skill developers:

1. Use voice profiles, if available
2. Don’t trust behavioral data from communal devices
3. Build pseudo-identities of the location, rather than a person
4. Ask when in doubt

Also, you can find a recent talk version of this post with the [Bots & AI meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bots-and-Artificial-Intelligence/):

I hope this advice is helpful as we build skills (and eventually platforms) that are better adopted for everyone in the home!
