<p>This newsletter was completed before the tragic death of Sir David Amess. Shocking, horrific, and yet wonderful to read the tributes to his decency from all sides of the political spectrum; yet another sad loss and another call for us to be better, kinder people.</p><p>I say ‘completed’ but, having realised Revue (despite being owned by twitter) doesn’t pull in all my feeds, I had begin going through them and chucking in the ‘most relevant’. I think I only went back about three days and there are far more than anyone is likely to ever read!</p><p>One thing I notice is that the ‘ethics’ section just grows and grows. Is that a ‘passion’ like systems ¦ cybernetics ¦ complexity — or is it just the righteous indignation that social media loves to throw at us, that is contribution to divisiveness and loss? I will have to think about that one. And find a way to make this much, much shorter.</p><h3>Top phive of the week</h3><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/antlerboy/status/1447545848167112706?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Practice #systemschange #systemsinnovation #systemsconvening</a></h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/antlerboy/status/1447545848167112706">twitter.com</a></p><p>Come and learn and share ideas about systems change, using citizen fire safety and my some models and ideas as examples: Monday 25 Oct 16:30 UK time Register: <a href="https://bit.ly/3Dm0veW">https://bit.ly/3Dm0veW</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*u4eVKPWNCZLHqsGF" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/10/scenario-planning-for-the-daysafter/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>Scenario planning for the #daysafter</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/10/scenario-planning-for-the-daysafter/"><strong>www.publicservicetransformation.org</strong></a></p><p>Full presentation Drawing on our engagement with our learning community to build back better in the days after, this presentation focuses on the four scenarios developed in that work: Also covered — our vision for the days after: And the Adaptive Council model: The full document is here</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/10/scenario-planning-for-the-daysafter/">Scenario planning for the #daysafter</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org">PSTA</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*h3PpqFtgGA6NsYdo" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/10/11/a-whodunnit-involving-football-pitches-desire-lines-and-a-broken-arm/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>A whodunnit involving football pitches, desire lines, and a broken arm</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/10/11/a-whodunnit-involving-football-pitches-desire-lines-and-a-broken-arm/"><strong>chosen-path.org</strong></a> <br> Here’s a puzzle for you.

English councils have budgets in excess of £50 billion. Not that you’d know it. Our political leaders seem to forget it all too easily. I’ve read again the prime minister’s statement about reforms to social care funding. He did not even mention local councils. Yet it is they, not central government, that are responsible for providing, funding and administering most social care. Local government has also been in the front line both in the response to Covid and dealing with its sometimes extreme financial consequences. Croydon and Slough have both issued so-called section 114 notices, indicating an inability to balance their budgets and the need to suspend all non-essential services. A number of other councils with specific exposures — Luton because it owns the airport, Eastbourne because of its dependence on tourism and conferences, for example — have had extraordinary additional support and borrowing powers granted…</p><h4><a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/10/using-social-value-principles-to-commission-services-and-for-community-wealth-building-webinar-with-e3m-19th-october/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Using social value principles to commission services and for community wealth building — Webinar with E3M, 19th October</a></h4><p><a href="https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/2021/10/using-social-value-principles-to-commission-services-and-for-community-wealth-building-webinar-with-e3m-19th-october/">www.publicservicetransformation.org</a></p><p>19th October, 2021, and 12:00–13:30 This webinar by E3M will focus on how people in local authorities, social enterprises, charities, and other organisations can seek to maximise public benefit.
