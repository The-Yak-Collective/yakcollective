# TryHackMe: Complete Beginner

# Metasploit

## Rock ‘em To the Core

The `spool` command can be used to save all Metasploit console output to a log file, which can be useful for record-keeping.

## Modules for Every Occasion!

Core Metasploit modules:

- EXPLOIT code;
- Post-exploitation PAYLOADs;
- AUXILIARY functions, such as scanning machines for vulnerabilities;
- POST exploitation tools for “looting” and pivoting;
- An ENCODER module for obfuscating exploits;
- And finally a module called NOP that includes tools for exploiting buffer overflows and return-orientated programming.

Note that Metasploit 6 apparently calls these “framework plugins” now.
