<p>Someone I know asked directions in Dublin. Receiving them, he followed up ‘can I walk there?’</p><p>‘To be sure I suppose you could walk anywhere’</p><p>The way we understand the context of our actions shapes our possibilities.</p><p>Once you know about context cues, you will start seeing them everywhere.</p><p>And there are big implications.</p><p>A ‘context cue’ or context marker is something in the environment which alerts you to *what the context expects of you*, what is appropriate behaviour.</p><p>&gt; Dogs ‘bow’ to each other to show that they are just playing.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*7Si-HAs91KCPdk67" /></figure><p>&gt; When you attend a major court, you usually have to walk up steep steps, into a building which overwhelms human scale; it’s like turning your eyes up to God as a lowly supplicant.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*LkvZdXqkkMHHf4ys" /></figure><p>&gt; To see my doctor, I must: first call his servants; be offered an appointment within his schedule; attend in good time, present the proper papers to his gatekeepers; await his pleasure and availability with the other plebs in the waiting room; be called (at his convenience); approach the audience chamber; knock upon it; be granted entrance; and be asked to take my place upon the secondary seat before his throne, where I see he has the proper Doctorly clothing, the bigger seat, and exclusive access to the computer, the source of power.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*a7ozLb6JZGmhRS3D" /></figure><p>&gt; Peter Block calls the annual review ‘that courtly ritual where I see my underlings and let them know two things: I own you, and you’re insufficient’</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*IY8eOjsHYj1Bhd0w" /></figure><p>&gt; to become a student at Oxford University, I had to ‘matriculate’ — demonstrate my compliance with their rituals and language by attending a ceremony where I had to wear ‘subfusc’ (white shirt and white bowtie, dark suit, black trousers, gown and mortar-board hat). I died my hair pillarbox red…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*rwk5pCUe5M8R1qa9" /></figure><p>Other examples: people react differently to a scene on the street and in the theatre (but if you suddenly realise you’ve been watching street theatre, your framing changes); other examples include taking a placebo, an air raid alarm, and a handshake before a boxing match.</p><p>‘We shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us’ said Winston Churchill; later generations remember ‘we shape our tools — and, thereafter, our tools shape us’. As a special educational need teacher and adviser, my mum often used the phrase ‘settings have plans for their inhabitants’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*JDh3ci2r1EaGStHK" /></figure><p>Being aware of context cues gives you power. It suggests both how to behave and the expected limits to behaviour, it reveals power dynamics and expectations.</p><p>It shows the worn paths and tracks, or the designed framing. It’s up to you what you do with that. On online garden discussion groups, the most frequent question is a photo with the caption ‘is this a weed?’</p><p>And the answer is always ‘it depends’.</p><h3><strong>What are your favourite examples of context cues?</strong></h3><p>Quote Investigator on the ‘we shape’ quote: <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/">https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/</a></p><p>The concept of ‘context markers’ comes from Gregory Bateson, in Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972) — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind</a> / <a href="https://ejcj.orfaleacenter.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1972.-Gregory-Bateson-Steps-to-an-Ecology-of-Mind.pdf">https://ejcj.orfaleacenter.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1972.-Gregory-Bateson-Steps-to-an-Ecology-of-Mind.pdf</a>)</p><p>Good discussions:</p><p><a href="http://www.narberthpa.com/Bale/lsbale_dop/gbtom_patp.pdf">http://www.narberthpa.com/Bale/lsbale_dop/gbtom_patp.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://books.google.rs/books?id=-6PhO7Og2fYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false">https://books.google.rs/books?id=-6PhO7Og2fYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false</a></p><p><a href="https://books.google.rs/books?id=R80AEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false">https://books.google.rs/books?id=R80AEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false</a></p><p><a href="https://books.google.rs/books?id=p14gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false">https://books.google.rs/books?id=p14gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false</a></p><p><a href="https://books.google.rs/books?id=16K5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false">https://books.google.rs/books?id=16K5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22context+markers%22+bateson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22context%20markers%22%20bateson&amp;f=false</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c7ebc9187afe" width="1" height="1" alt="">
