We started Wider Team by interviewing IoT leaders during the pandemic. A wide range of healthcare, biopharmaceutical, and energy sector professionals. Job titles varied widely. Our interviews were about an hour each, over Zoom, mostly. Recorded with consent for our research but not for attribution. A structured interview, about one third each on their IoT applications, the role of authentic data in their work, and their hopes and fears for the future.

We analyzed what they said and we report our findings. First to our participants. And then online and at conferences and other events.

Weâ€™re setting up a new wave of interviews. Got an hour?
