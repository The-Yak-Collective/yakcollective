This will be a temptation for all of us.</p><p>Leaders who are fit for the #future need to be able to balance thriving in the here and now with adapting to an uncertain and complex future, without being tempted to get stuck back in the reassuring simplicity of the past. There’s no God coming to save us, nor can you be a God yourself; you just have to keep learning and working… and you will need personal, team, organisational, system, and social agility.</p><p>If this intrigues, come to join us at Requisite Agility unleashed: <a href="https://www.requisiteagility.org/attend/ra-unleashed-conference">https://www.requisiteagility.org/attend/ra-unleashed-conference</a></p><p>If you have read this far, you deserve the code RAUN50 which gives you 50% off the Learning Pass.</p><p>I’m thrilled to be joined at the conference by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Stephen Clement</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Philip Boxer</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Dave Snowden</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Eve Simon</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Scott W.
