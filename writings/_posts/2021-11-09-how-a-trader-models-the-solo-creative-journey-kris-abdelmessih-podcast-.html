<p>Kris Abdelmessih has one of the most unique perspectives on life and works I&#8217;ve stumbled across in the past few years. He uses his experience as a trader to look at decision-making and work investments through the lens of options, pricing, and other financial models.  I enjoy his perspective &#8211; unlike other financial types, he seems to have a proper appreciation of non-work / non-productive time.</p>



<p>We explore his recent break from trading, his creative journey writing on the internet, and finding his people, and he challenges me to think differently about how I&#8217;m spending my time with my work.</p>



<p>The conversation dramatically shifted how I&#8217;m thinking about the possibilities of my path.  If you are on a self-employed path, this is a must-listen:</p>
