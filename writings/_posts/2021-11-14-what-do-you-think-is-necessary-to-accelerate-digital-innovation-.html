<p>I am one of 16 professional advisers interviewed for advice on how to manage accelerating enterprise digital transformation in these uncertain times.</p><p>The publication from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">TechPros.io</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Network Sunday</a> is at <a href="https://techprosio.foleon.com/network-sunday-and-techpros-articles/accelerating-enterprise-digital-transformation/cover/">https://techprosio.foleon.com/network-sunday-and-techpros-articles/accelerating-enterprise-digital-transformation/cover/</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FzJ2IYj_3T-9z3M2oW7-kg.png" /></figure><p>What’s fascinating is you get a very different tone and personality of the business from each interview!</p><p>The top tips I get from the whole are:</p><p>1- focus on good customer experience / #customerrelations first — slow down to make sure you really understand what you’re doing for the customer</p><p>2- remember your people work from positive motivation — help them feel good about successes and learn from failures, since digital will involve both. Train and upskill them to deal with the pace of change</p><p>3- be realistic about what tools and technologies — including machine learning, ‘AI’, and ‘RPA’ (robotic process automation — screenscrapers) can do. Smash the jargon and focus on what works</p><p>4- focus on collaboration around value streams, whether in an agile ‘team of teams’ working virtually, or a traditional organisation in an office</p><p>5- learn what works and what doesn’t from the experience of others</p><p>6- don’t shy away from ‘fixing the plumbing’ — improving what’s broken can bring better results than whizzy new ideas</p><p>I’ll share more of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">RedQuadrant</a> perspective in a future post, though you can read me in there!</p><p>What are your top tips for digital acceleration?</p><p>#data #technology #management</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f17b045cb435" width="1" height="1" alt="">
