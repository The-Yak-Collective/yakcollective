<h2 id="mal-malware-introductory">MAL: Malware Introductory</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-malware-analysis">What Is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?</h3>
<p>Three objectives of malware analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it spread?</li>
<li>What are its IOCs?</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-if-a-malware-attack-has-happened">Identifying if a Malware Attack Has Happened</h3>
<p>Malware lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Persistence (sometimes)</li>
<li>Propagation (sometimes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two of these stages are generally the noisiest. <em>Persistence</em> produces primarily (only?) <em>host-based</em> signatures, while <em>propagation</em> leads to more <em>network-based</em> signatures.</p>
<p>Malware is generally classed by how it <em>executes</em> (i.e., what it does).</p>
<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic-analysis">Static vs. Dynamic Analysis</h3>
<p>The difference here basically boils down to: Did you run it?</p>
<p>Seems like it’s probably best to do dynamic analysis in a cloud VM or something. Though a lot of malware tries to detect if it’s running in a VM these days, so…</p>
<h3 id="discussion-of-provided-tools--their-uses">Discussion of Provided Tools &amp; Their Uses</h3>
<p>Some malware can actually spread over RDP. Ack!</p>
<h3 id="now-lets-see-if-the-md5-checksums-have-been-analyzed-before">Now Let’s See if the MD5 Checksums Have Been Analyzed Before</h3>
<p>I hadn’t noticed this before, but you can submit a file hash to VirusTotal instead uploading a file or submitting a URL. Handy!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virustotal.com">VirusTotal</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-if-the-executables-are-obfuscated--packed">Identifying if the Executables are Obfuscated / Packed</h3>
<p>It seems like Windows executables have a magic number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4D 5A</code>.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="introduction-to-strings">Introduction to Strings</h3>
<p>Microsoft Sysinternals has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strings</code> command. Neat!</p>
