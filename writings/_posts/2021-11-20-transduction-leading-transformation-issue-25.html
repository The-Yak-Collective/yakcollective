I work in public service transformation. I love insight porn, but I prefer everything-you-know-is-wrong porn. I enjoy whimsy and wry humour and it turns out I care a lot about ethics, especially in the conduct of public life. I guess I’ll share a lot more as we go on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*NKCwvH-EpZ8FdIS1" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2020/08/28/an-invitation-to-the-redquadrant-tool-shed/?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=bufferc6742&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><strong>An invitation to the RedQuadrant tool shed — the once-chosen path</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2020/08/28/an-invitation-to-the-redquadrant-tool-shed/?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=bufferc6742&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><strong>chosen-path.org</strong></a> <br> An invitation to the RedQuadrant tool shed Over nearly twenty-four years of service transformation, 15 as a consultant, and twelve years of running RedQuadrant as a network consultancy, I have developed a rich multi-methodology approach which is highly applicable for anyone who wants to transform organisations and their results.

This led to significant changes on the back of Professor Alexis Jay’s report into the handling of CSE in Rotherham in 2014. Her report brought to light the previously unknown scale of the problem, estimating that at least 1,400 children in Rotherham experienced CSE over a number of years, largely ignored by those responsible for their care and protection. The response — alongside the work of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, also chaired by Alexis Jay — has included a far greater focus on CSE.
