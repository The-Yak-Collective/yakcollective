This is the first issue I’m sharing on ‘native’ LinkedIn as well as GetRevue, so I’m reintroducing myself and also highlighting links from my first three newsletters, back in June…

This newsletter is a collection of links to my social media activity and gatherings, usually for the past week.

If you want to subscribe to the getRevue directly, go to [https://www.getrevue.co/profile/antlerboy](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/antlerboy)

I also curate everything systems | cybernetics | complexity at the [systems community of inquiry](http://www.syscoi.com ), and blog at [www.chosen-path.org](http://www.chosen-path.org) (or if you prefer, [https://antlerboy.medium.com/](https://antlerboy.medium.com/) — I post everything to both places and LinkedIn updates at the same time).

All my contact details and social media links (@antlerboy on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antlerboy?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/in/antlerboy?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) are at [www.bentaylor.com](http://www.bentaylor.com/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). I share a lot of things on twitter, but try to keep my postings down on LinkedIn. I also publish relevant items at [www.govtransformation.org](http://www.govtransformation.org) and on [publicservicetransformation.org](https://www.publicservicetransformation.org/category/news/)

### what I stand for

I’m passionate about the systems | cybernetics | complexity field, and about trying to change things for the better. I work in public service transformation. I love insight porn, but I prefer everything-you-know-is-wrong porn. I enjoy whimsy and wry humour and it turns out I care a lot about ethics, especially in the conduct of public life. I guess I’ll share a lot more as we go on.

 An invitation to the RedQuadrant tool shed Over nearly twenty-four years of service transformation, 15 as a consultant, and twelve years of running RedQuadrant as a network consultancy, I have developed a rich multi-methodology approach which is highly applicable for anyone who wants to transform organisations and their results.

 How organisations relate to their contexts is critical. I’m talking customers, consumers, and citizens. The purpose of organisation is to create value for them. The learning ladder of purpose (a work in progress) helps us to think about how we are engaging in the world.

By Claire Bethel

Child sexual exploitation (CSE) had a high profile following the public outcry which ensued from the widespread abuse in places such as Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxford. This led to significant changes on the back of Professor Alexis Jay’s report into the handling of CSE in Rotherham in 2014. Her report brought to light the previously unknown scale of the problem, estimating that at least 1,400 children in Rotherham experienced CSE over a number of years, largely ignored by those responsible for their care and protection. The response — alongside the work of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, also chaired by Alexis Jay — has included a far greater focus on CSE. Whereas previously, child sexual abuse was viewed as largely a familial problem, the exploitation of children by perpetrators outside the family including groups and gangs, as well as by their peers, has commanded far wider recognition.
