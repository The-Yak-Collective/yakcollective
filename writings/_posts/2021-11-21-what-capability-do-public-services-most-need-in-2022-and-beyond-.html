<h3>The degree of stress, pressure, and overwhelm seems to have been growing for the last twelve years, with crushing austerity accelerated by the twin crises of COVID-19 and “Brexit”.</h3><p>We have learned that we can rise to the occasion, as heroes — but the slow crises are even harder to deal with.</p><p>The challenges of climate catastrophe and simply trying to really make a difference in the world of citizens and communities, to maintain basic services, asks the impossible of us over longer periods of time.</p><p>We have learned that the more we centralise, the more we lose the connections with people’s lives.</p><p>We have learned that *we* have to be the people we are waiting for.</p><p>And when it’s all, truly, too much, we need to start to play on a bigger stage. We need to focus on:</p><p>- the outcomes we can influence for people, not just the provision of services against demand.</p><p>- the strengths that people can bring to bear, not just their needs and what they lack.</p><p>- ourselves as a part of the community and place, not the centre of the universe.</p><p>We need to double down on continual learning, changing how we think about our work, and even our identity, as well as learning to do our work better, to create the <strong>#innovation</strong> we need.</p><p>And we need to focus on the ethics of being part of a community.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*exDG61UWLOh5hMuf" /></figure><p>We identified twelve requirements for adaptive public services and the <strong>#adaptivecouncil</strong>:</p><p>1. Be highly effective in systems thinking and the navigation of <strong>#complexity</strong> to meet the inter-related complexity of these challenges.</p><p>2. Work across boundaries and lead collaboratively — because the capabilities of a single organisation are no longer able to shape the kind of outcomes required.</p><p>3. Balance the deep technical skills still needed to play our role and deliver services, with emerging projects and collaboration</p><p>4. Embrace ‘municipal entrepreneurialism’, a creative and flexible approach to outcomes and risk rather than defensive focus, to generate income</p><p>5. Be highly engaged with adult development, with a practical focus: the need to have more ability to make sense of complex situations</p><p>6. Develop effective, open governance — critical to enable the other elements and for democratic legitimacy.</p><p>7. To address the trust deficit, be trustworthy.</p><p>8. Develop insight-led understanding, based on real understanding of people’s lives.</p><p>9. Offer a new flexible employment approach to fit in with lives and priorities.</p><p>10. Shape culture and identity in the organisation, partners, and community.</p><p>11. Generate rich, multi-level learning by reflecting on our actions.</p><p>12. Act as equal citizens, breaking from the model of ‘provider and customer’</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iRKLw_sbNqvOd_I94HfcKw.png" /></figure><h3>What’s the one capability you think public services most need in the <strong>#future</strong>?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fd01fd117fed" width="1" height="1" alt="">
