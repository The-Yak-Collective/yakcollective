<h3>What’s your favourite saying that you invented?*</h3><p>(* it might be that, like mine, yours are not *really* unique — but don’t worry about that for today :-) )</p><p>See others’ contributions at:</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_taylors-law-activity-6869182907479683072-cM0Z">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_taylors-law-activity-6869182907479683072-cM0Z</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/728/0*UDHxt64OOSfjYcKT.jpg" /></figure><p>Here are mine:</p><p><strong>Taylor’s Corollary to Pareto’s Law for projects</strong></p><p>the first 20% of value takes 80% of budget/time. The other 80% of value takes the other 80% of the budget/time.</p><p><strong>Taylor’s rule of proposal recursion</strong></p><p>if a proposal requires you to stay up until 3am to get it done then, somehow, so will every major deliverable on that project.</p><p><strong>Taylor’s law of bidding</strong></p><p>the more you really really care about the proposal and the work, the less likely you are to win.</p><p><strong>Taylor’s first rule of Workshop Time</strong></p><p>you will think there is not enough content for the time. In fact, there is not enough time for the content</p><p><strong>Taylor’s second rule of Workshop Time</strong></p><p>if at point x you’re twenty minutes ahead of agenda, in thirty minutes, you will be thirty minutes behind.</p><p>(To which I received:</p><p><strong>Pickering’s first rule of workshops:</strong> the sooner you get behind, the longer you have to catch up.)</p><p><strong>Taylor’s Law of Tables Where One Side Of The Table Shows The Bad Old Stuff And The Other Side Shows The Good New Stuff</strong></p><p>this means that someone is using propaganda to sell you something — either a product or a worldview</p><p><strong>Taylor’s Law of Cognitive Hierarchies</strong></p><p>Any time someone presents you with a hierarchy of adult development or cognitive capability levels, they believe they are at a higher level than you.</p><p>What would you put in your name?</p><p>Shout-out to Mel Conway who has a seriously good law named after him! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law</a></p><p>(I find it amusing that he is called @Conways_Law on Twitter, since @ConwaysLaw was already taken — by an Irish law firm :-) )</p><p>And let’s also acknowledge Stigler’s Law of Eponymy; no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy</a></p><p>“Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble’s law</a>, which was derived by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> two years before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#History">was known</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics">Babylonian mathematicians</a> before Pythagoras, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet">Halley’s Comet</a>, which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC (although its official designation is due to the first ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley#Publications_and_inventions">mathematical prediction</a> of such astronomical phenomenon in the sky, not to its discovery). Stigler himself named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist">sociologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton">Robert K. Merton</a> as the discoverer of “Stigler’s law” to show that it follows its own decree, though the phenomenon had previously been noted by others.”</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8c424025ae3b" width="1" height="1" alt="">
