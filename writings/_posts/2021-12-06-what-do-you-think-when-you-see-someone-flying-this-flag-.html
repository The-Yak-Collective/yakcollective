<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SIjWeQuCi-SGSIqp-ywIiw.png" /></figure><p>My view is that the least British thing of all to do is to fly the flag, outside of very special ceremonies and very limited occasions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y1egWlqTvcoAyN3mLm6Oqw.png" /></figure><p>In the ‘Cool Britannia’ era, ‘progressives’ like me began to feel it was ‘safe’ — and maybe a good thing — to embrace a bit of patriotism. This was perhaps not unconnected to Blairite Labour being in power — and perhaps a cause and an effect.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tYcu8nDDlyI8YUn01sl_EA.png" /></figure><p>The Flag took over everything — cake tins to dresses to cars to underwear.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zPEoXop3J7d6mDhL30dTlA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ohFqnP4Ek7aIhQBG2BpPyA.png" /></figure><p>And the nationalism and militarism which I had always suspected began to gain a little traction.</p><p>Then ‘keep calm and carry on’, the flag and harking back to the mid-20th Century and national pride as a part of Austerity came in. A justification and a consolation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oBnw-sEs-d2SBC18Nkbd8A.png" /></figure><p>When bunting and cup-cakes were flavour of the month, someone I know who has seen engineered regime change told me to keep my eyes open. ‘They’re manipulating us — it’ll be time for war and back to Lords and Serfs, you know’. I scoffed.</p><p>But, come on, who really likes cup-cakes? The nation in hock to Big Sugar, I suspect.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/914/1*Ogb4fkoZORtRora_yzs6Xg.png" /></figure><p>And now we have the flag everywhere, we’ve reduced the true solemnity of marking the horrors of war to a sentimental poppyfest. We used to be at Sunday football matches on Remembrance Sunday. A minute of true silence, true respect. And we moved on with a tear in the eye.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*By90POPXk2rGgOmfK8PN4g.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V5AjzhAyyeYQaG0TJAJ5sw.png" /></figure><p>I want to be a patriot. For a while, I thought it was safe and empowering to do so.</p><p>But I fear that it empowers only the worst nationalism and militarism.</p><p>I stole this idea from someone on twitter — it seems such a symbol of the UK’s journey.</p><p><strong>What next? How can we reclaim the flag and British values it could stand for?</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvUG6NLIuJ0aWOZEnBKlTw.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8f4a932a19ea" width="1" height="1" alt="">
