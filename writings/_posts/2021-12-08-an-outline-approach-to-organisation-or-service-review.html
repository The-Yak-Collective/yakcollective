<p>What tools, approaches, perspectives do you reach for when you have to review an organisation, service, team, or department?</p><p>Here’s my ‘go to’ list when I am asked to look at a whole ‘service’, usually in public services.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/0*HjtMB9DVDziUKCfa" /></figure><p>This is a sketch of methods and views we use to try to get a rounded view in order to make savings, improvements, or completely reconsider for transformation and innovation.</p><p>What do you use? How does it compare?</p><p>1. Context — strategy view</p><p>Where is the organisation in relation to context, landscape, partners, suppliers, customers, the future?</p><p>We do horizon scanning, scenario planning, look at three horizons, and use the Patterns of Strategy approach to understand structural coupling.</p><p>2. Purpose and measures</p><p>We look at the ‘<a href="https://chosen-path.org/2020/08/28/the-force-in-organisational-life-and-becoming-a-jedi-the-beginning/">POSIWID</a>’ — purpose derived from the results the organisation consistently produces — to get at purpose.</p><p>Look at measures, incentives, and framing to understand why it does what it does, and take a critical perspective on who benefits.</p><p>Learning and improvement mechanisms — how is the organisation learning about its results, to do better, to reframe, to reconfigure its identity?</p><p>3. Leading and governing the work</p><p>How are decisions actually made?<br>Where does the organisation stand with the five key practices?<br>How is accountability handled?<br>What are the stories that illustrate the culture?</p><p>4. Managing the work</p><p>We analyse responsibility/authority/expertise/work against key value streams and look a the clarity and appropriateness of boundaries and discretion and management.</p><p>What are the development opportunities?</p><p>5. Customer/citizen insight</p><p>What is the citizen/customer need and purpose?<br>We use customer journey mapping and ethnographic work</p><p>6. Demand view — demand analysis: what are citizens/customers actually asking for?</p><p>7. Channel analysis — which groups access which services over which channel?</p><p>8. Policy/commissioning — what are the policy and commissioning decisions regarding what demand, need, and purpose is met and how?</p><p>9. Flow — how do we ensure capacity and capability at the point of demand?</p><p>10. Process view — core process work and ‘three levels of fix’ to move from process to wider systems</p><p>11. Supporting the work — accommodation / workstyles / support / technology / data</p><p>12. Organisation and sourcing — how is the work structured and capability procured?</p><p>13. Resource view — we look at core, support, and diversionary work and do resource optimisation — what activity can be trimmed, transformed, transferred, terminated, and what must be tolerated</p><p>14. Outcome and costs — what does a wider perspective say about the total cost and benefit?</p><p>Some of this will be familiar to those familiar with our <a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/01/14/there-are-only-seven-ways-to-make-savings-and-improvements-in-service-organisations/">‘seven ways to save and improve’</a>.</p><p>How does this compare to what you do?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1e611460dbd4" width="1" height="1" alt="">
