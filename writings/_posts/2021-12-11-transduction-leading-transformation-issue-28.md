 Every Monday and Wednesday I do a LinkedIn post that I put some special effort into.

 What tools, approaches, perspectives do you reach for when you have to review an organisation, service, team, or department? Here’s my ‘go to’ list when I am asked to look at a whole ‘service’, usually in public services.

 My view is that the least British thing of all to do is to fly the flag, outside of very special ceremonies and very limited occasions. In the ‘Cool Britannia’ era, ‘progressives’ like me began to feel it was ‘safe’ — and maybe a good thing — to embrace a bit of patriotism. This was perhaps not unconnected to … [Continue reading What do you think when you see someone flying this flag? →](https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/06/what-do-you-think-when-you-see-someone-flying-this-flag%ef%bf%bc/)

 Our global systems are fragmented and collapsing in front of us. Here I share my perspective on why systems are broken, my experience working with intractable issues that cross many boundaries and my call to leverage our role as social scientists.
