<p><em>What else have you noticed that degrades over time? What are the organisational equivalents of these theories?</em></p><h3><strong>Tomato inflation</strong></h3><p>When I was a kid, the tomatoes from Derek, our local greengrocer, were *proper tasty*.</p><p>Juicy and full of flavour.</p><p>In those days, you could confidently buy a tomato in any shop, and it tasted of tomato.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y565Z_qv6YWIj6cewi0XiA.png" /><figcaption>This is my favourite tomato: the Novosadski Jabucar. The Serbian word for tomato is ‘paradise’.</figcaption></figure><p>If you grow your own, or live in or visit a country still connected to the land, you might still experience this today. But.</p><p>An excitement of my youth was the arrival on the market of cherry tomatoes. This was a big deal! Sweet, juicy — these were <strong>proper </strong>tomatoes!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pCH8Ff-MgedKceGg58ynGw.png" /></figure><p>Because the ordinary tomatoes had, somehow, got less good.</p><p>Bland. Uninspiring. Flavourless.</p><p>Then, you know what? They brought them back! Or, at least, Tomatoes On The Vine. These were the <strong>real</strong> deal. Luscious, bursting with real flavour.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WV468oAkAa4RHrHqTLEfXQ.png" /></figure><p>Which was a good job, because the cherry tomatoes had somehow… lost their edge. Started to seem a bit plastic.</p><p>Eventually, Cherry Tomatoes on the Vine supplanted the ordinary vine variety… and we’re now on to heirloom tomatoes.</p><p>Every few years, Tomato Inflation has you chasing that real tomato taste.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y_c5WrmUouPLyKJYqPxlMA.png" /></figure><p>Plum tomatoes, beef tomatoes, heritage tomatoes. Cherry plums. Vine <strong>ripened</strong>. Golden. The Kumato.</p><p>It could be partly mineral depletion in our soil. Partly expectations and the bringing of a new thing to market. And partly a genuine inflationary effect when the old thing gets mass-produced, cheapified, loses what makes it special. I’ll link to a couple of articles about the tomato business.</p><h3>The Latte event horizon is a parallel phenomenon.</h3><p>It’s like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">carcinisation</a> — the process by which everything evolves into a crab.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aGjTjzEWxXkgpa0qSFvSVA.png" /></figure><p>Eventually, every coffee becomes a latte.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rPvmRGndm10186t1Qx8_BA.png" /></figure><p>Let’s not talk of the coffee of my childhood, please. Back then, a pan of milk cooked with generous teaspoons of Gold Blend was the height of luxury.</p><p>Then, we discovered cappuccino, Roman-style. A small, strong espresso shot, tight foam not overblown and burned, a swirl of the milk and coffee.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYxUIZ-txz6HoRGUNuPOUg.png" /></figure><p>And, over time, the capu got bigger and bigger, the milk more dominant, looser, the coffee bloated. A latte.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fhB0XAuyWngC4knCZAlCdw.png" /></figure><p>Then came the Flat White, thanks to our Antipodean friends.</p><p>Double ristretto and just the right measure of microfoam milk.</p><p>Just like a cappuccino in Rome…</p><p>…and now you can buy a flat white in a 20oz bucket! More latte.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aBSeyN5I5Aj5vZXnTyNilw.png" /></figure><h3>What’s your take on this (anti) pattern?</h3><h3>Do you have examples?</h3><h3>Is there anything we can do about it?</h3><p>Coupla links on tomatoes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/science-has-created-the-perfect-tomato-but-grocery-stores-refuse-to-sell-it-2015-7">https://www.businessinsider.com/science-has-created-the-perfect-tomato-but-grocery-stores-refuse-to-sell-it-2015-7</a></li><li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/heirloom-tomato-types-varieties-shopping-guide">https://www.seriouseats.com/heirloom-tomato-types-varieties-shopping-guide</a></li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5e8ddfceb138" width="1" height="1" alt="">
