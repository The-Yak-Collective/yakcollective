<h3>I helped facilitate a large group drawn from all the ‘partners’ trying to join up and make their ‘place’ better.</h3><p>This was a partnership across police, health, fire, businesses, voluntary sector, several councils, and central government.</p><p>The idea was that, working together, they could get more autonomy to work locally around local problems — getting better results for the community and citizens, and saving public funds.</p><p>Truth be told, the real drivers were the specific government funding available for those putting in winning bids, and the ideology of the local politicians.</p><p>Trying to create ‘A3 thinking’ sheets for each programme element — a technique from lean which lists background, context, current condition and problem statement, and goal, then proceeds with rigour through root-cause analysis, countermeasures, check, and follow-up — was impossible. The goals and actions were logically incoherent in themselves.</p><p>Nevertheless, the participants were serious — verging on the idealistic.</p><p>This was an opportunity to do something to radically improve the conditions for people in the area, not just tweak services around the edges!</p><p>It was an opportunity to really deliver the joining-up that had been worked on for decades without real results.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/966/0*WNebMqQD_yrWGD01" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/0*6mzLQWHvcY3TD3TM" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/969/0*BFi91BZ_SuMu7DA3" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/0*HcF4iVoS4ptdl4C5" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/963/0*pa-Lyleo1dHcRTXS" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/965/0*sAwqPZ6o1JjNnggQ" /></figure><p>But there was a problem.</p><p>It became clear that the organisations were extremely different, and that they held some really big preconceived ideas about each other — but nobody was willing to discuss it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, we prepared an exercise for the kickoff event.</p><p>The representatives of each organisation sat in a circle.</p><p>We gave them an envelope, on which they wrote their organisation’s name.</p><p>Everyone passed the envelope clockwise, and then used index cards to write down what people in their organisation would typically think about the organisation whose envelope they were holding.</p><p>When the envelopes came all the way back round to the originators, each representative read out loud the cards they felt were worth sharing.</p><p>I think everyone read all the cards, and at times you could have cut the tension with a knife.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/971/0*YcPe0hWoq8GoYhKD" /></figure><p>We went for a coffee break. It was pretty awkward. But then, suddenly conversation took off!</p><p>After the break, we got into the realities of working together, as a team of people and as organisations.</p><p>But the real work was done when everyone saw what others really thought about them, and we made it permissible — even a requirement — to discuss it.</p><p><strong>Twist: it later turned out that many of the most negative, cliched views of each organisation had been contributed *by the representatives of that organisation themselves!*</strong></p><p>They knew. It just needed to be made discussable.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Have you experienced ways of surfacing these kinds of perceptions?</p><p>What they heard:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/949/0*Jjc90o-mywaS5Kw1" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/911/0*9PNVA2GzWuPMXLaZ" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/923/0*S0QS1vg45qEPVXYg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/950/0*uroKUpG0G8TC7m_x" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f1f43e380fe4" width="1" height="1" alt="">
