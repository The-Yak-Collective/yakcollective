I am taking a winter break from this newsletter through January 2022, starting today. Regular programming will resume in the first week of February.

For paying subscribers, billing will be paused until I hit the resume button. Your next bill date will be pushed out appropriately. If you have 12 days left on a monthly subscription right now, you’ll still have 12 days left when I resume. If you have 289 days left on an annual subscription, you’ll still have 289 days.

You’ll still have access to the [archives](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) as usual of course, so you can catch up on stuff you might have missed.

As I announced the last time I took a break in August-September, I’m hoping to hit a rhythm of a couple of long breaks every year, with billing paused (ie my vacations from this newsletter are unpaid), to allow me to balance various demands on my time.

Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!
