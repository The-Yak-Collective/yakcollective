<p>Have you ever been ‘referred’ or ‘signposted’? How did it feel?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s9h_HUB2KGdCV6cL" /></figure><p>We worked with one council to analyse the whole of their customer contact.</p><p>The council was very dedicated to accessibility and support to those in the community most in need.</p><p>What we found was that all the good intentions were a part of the problem.</p><p>Realising that their services were very complicated and quite hard to access, the council had invested heavily in advice, information, and advocacy services to support and improve access.</p><p>And when it was discovered that a community group had a particular need, another charity was supported to provide advice there.</p><p>What we discovered was an accretion of these advice-giving services that had layered up like sediment over the years.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*2t5qTOB-vTtcoGw5" /></figure><p>The effect was that citizens — especially those with the kind of combination of particular complex needs and social exclusion that the council was trying to combat — faced a bewildering array of choices.</p><p>Most of these would ‘signpost’ them to other services, and so on and so on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/0*h2aNqfS99B5GXuu-" /></figure><p>I experienced the same thing when looking for advice on the care of an elderly relative who’s losing his memory.</p><p>We made a formula for this, to make the point:</p><p>Complex service arrangements</p><p>x</p><p>complex customer access</p><p>x</p><p>complex advice and signposting arrangements</p><p>x</p><p>staff ‘going the extra mile’ to help the customer (people from one department would take the case forward, advocate, chase)</p><p>equals</p><p>‘The pinball council’</p><p>‘Pinball organisations’ are those who are working hard to do the wrong thing right.</p><p>It all seems so logical, from a certain point of view.</p><p>But let’s look at just one problem: ‘referral fatigue’</p><p>This is the phenomenon by which there can be a **40% or higher** drop-off with each referral. Even when people are seeking support for really important legal problems.</p><p>So ‘making a referral’, usually counted as ‘one item of success’ in performance reporting, should really be seen as a service failure on a par with waiting lists, triage, queues, checking, following up, and waiting.</p><p>Other problems which I’ll look at later include the pantomime of ‘the waiting list’, making the customer play ‘guess the game’ with your processes, and the self-generating, self-licking ice-cream.</p><p>What was it like when you were ‘signposted’?
