<h3>Well, that’s a classic show-stopper, isn’t it?</h3><p>How often have you heard that in a workshop or discussion?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PEfGoVjTU3Yr-Zz_Wh2iRA.png" /></figure><p>Power, like ‘leadership’, ‘innovation’, ‘culture’, and ‘transformation’, is one of those — ahem — power words. Very often, it allows us to seem deep and reflective, without actually getting anywhere.</p><p>It’s frequently gesturing at a real feeling, a real set of issues — in the meeting or workshop context, often that there are a set of assumptions or structures that benefit certain people, that aren’t being discussed or challenged.</p><p>But labelling it as ‘about power’ often raises the stakes without changing the game.</p><p>And this is probably irredeemable, because power, like those other words, means different things in different contexts and frameworks at different times — so, however neat your definition, it doesn’t particularly matter because someone else will be using it for an entirely different reason.</p><p>Yet we can’t get away from the word and the concept. We feel it all the time.</p><p>I can’t condense down my thoughts about power into a LinkedIn post, partly because they’re not finished yet. But I’m sharing my work in progress (the power of vulnerability?) and my best idea yet:</p><p>To understand power, looking into a situation:</p><p>•What is the situation?</p><p>•Who are the actors?</p><p>What purposes</p><p>•are being sought?</p><p>•are being achieved?</p><p>•are being espoused?</p><p>Context cues and framing</p><p>•What are the boundaries of appropriate actions?</p><p>•How are they set?</p><p>•How are they enforced?</p><p>Affordances</p><p>•What actions are possible within the boundaries?</p><p>And what is the history?</p><p>Then, look at how all the above is established — and what the implications are.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/920/1*91Fl9XyT2caQImQ1eXUk-w.png" /></figure><p>Work in progress, anyway…</p><h3>What is your definition of power?
