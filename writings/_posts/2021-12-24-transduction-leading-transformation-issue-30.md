 Well, that’s a classic show-stopper, isn’t it? How often have you heard that in a workshop or discussion? Power, like ‘leadership’, ‘innovation’, ‘culture’, and ‘transformation’, is one of those — ahem — power words. Very often, it allows us to seem deep and reflective, without actually getting anywhere. It’s frequently gesturing at a real feeling, a real set of issues — in … [Continue reading “We aren’t talking enough about power” →](https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/23/we-arent-talking-enough-about-power/)

 How did the internet disrupt 20th century timekeeping systems and spark an insurgence of alternative historical narratives? How do old media institutions try (and fail) to keep up with the narratives of online subcultures? How does the immediate accessibility of so many alt histories undermine our ability to create shared visions of the future? And how might a more ecological awareness of the internet help us adapt to our disorienting digital time machines?

 Nicolaus Copernicus was the orphaned son of a copper merchant . In his book ‘On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres’ he presented an Earth-shattering new idea — that maybe it wasn’t actually at the centre of the universe as everyone believed, but in fact, revolved around the Sun. Although it would take another century until Galileo was able to prove him right, Copernicus’s book, published in 1543 in Nuremberg, would mark the beginning of a very real revolution in science.

Informally, the theorem states that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. Tarski’s undefinability theorem — Wikipedia
