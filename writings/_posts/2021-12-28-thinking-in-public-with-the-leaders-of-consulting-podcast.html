<p>My friend Johnathan Baillie Strong has a new podcast dedicated to independent consultants called <a href="https://spotlightpodcasting.com/leaders-of-consulting/">Leaders of Consulting</a> and I was one of the first few guests - I love the focus of the podcast, thereâ€™s very little directly for indies!</p>
