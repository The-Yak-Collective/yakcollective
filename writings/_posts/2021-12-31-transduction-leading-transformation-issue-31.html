<p>Some of my highlights from the last week and a few bits from issue 14 back in September (a short one, as I was enjoying my first holiday in 18 months).</p><p>This is a bit lower-effort again, as I am now triple-jabbed (with the ‘powerful’ AZ and Pfizer combo) thanks once again to the generosity and organisational effectiveness of the Serbian government — and already feeling rough.</p><p>To end the year business-wise a tender loss by 1.39%, again with no pitch or interview. I honestly feel public sector procurement has got a lot more unpredictable recently! But I am broadly quite optimistic and excited by what 2020-two has to offer, I’m looking forward to taking RedQuadrant forward in exciting new ways, the Public Service Transformation Academy is going well, systems | complexity | cybernetics grows in prominence and some things in that space and in my ‘meta-consulting’ work are looking promising.</p><p>I hope you have a wonderful New Year and enjoy all the fruits of your labours in 2022…</p><h3>Top phive of the week</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*zRZvtfPuXa6d98UE" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/29/how-are-you-experiencing-what-your-customers-experience/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>How are you experiencing what your customers experience?</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/29/how-are-you-experiencing-what-your-customers-experience/"><strong>chosen-path.org</strong></a></p><p>When leaders have no idea of the real-life experience of their service, finding out can be a hell of a shock.
