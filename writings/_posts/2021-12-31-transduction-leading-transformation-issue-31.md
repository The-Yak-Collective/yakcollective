Some of my highlights from the last week and a few bits from issue 14 back in September (a short one, as I was enjoying my first holiday in 18 months).

This is a bit lower-effort again, as I am now triple-jabbed (with the ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô AZ and Pfizer combo) thanks once again to the generosity and organisational effectiveness of the Serbian government‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand already feeling rough.

To end the year business-wise a tender loss by 1.39%, again with no pitch or interview. I honestly feel public sector procurement has got a lot more unpredictable recently! But I am broadly quite optimistic and excited by what 2020-two has to offer, I‚Äôm looking forward to taking RedQuadrant forward in exciting new ways, the Public Service Transformation Academy is going well, systems | complexity | cybernetics grows in prominence and some things in that space and in my ‚Äòmeta-consulting‚Äô work are looking promising.

I hope you have a wonderful New Year and enjoy all the fruits of your labours in 2022‚Ä¶

When leaders have no idea of the real-life experience of their service, finding out can be a hell of a shock. That‚Äôs how the Smarter Borough Hotline nearly got me fired.

In markets without much competition, organisations can deliver bad service not because of poor design and management, but simply because they can. Benjamin P.

### Thinking about Graceland

I have a specific memory of the Christmas after Graceland came out, decorating the tree and the living, me and my brother both in our pyjamas and highly flammable nylon dressing room, supervised by my mum. My dad comes back from town with a CD for our new CD player, wired to the big box speakers in the living room. It‚Äôs Graceland, and it feels like something out of this world, special, and connected to us. I guess thinking about Desmond Tutu also stirred this memory, but I often remember it at this time of year.

The history of Graceland is rich, complex, and fraught with allegations and politics.
