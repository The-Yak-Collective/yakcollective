<h3>Are you actually able to hear where you can create value?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Q5JSTNuZ2-q08rox" /></figure><p>I was once in a project to redesign a council’s Housing Benefits form, and ‘make it digital’.</p><p>The form was 60 pages long, and optimally designed for approximately 2.2% of applicants.</p><p>That’s because the vast majority of applicants were already on a ‘passporting benefit’, so we really only needed to verify that and could start housing benefits almost immediately.</p><p>On the other hand, really complex cases needed a lot more bespoke attention than just the form.</p><p>A small business owner was making a loss and, after several hours with their accountant, we worked out they were eligible.</p><p>​After weeks of research and work, where we mapped out routes and flows and logic trees, and sketched out an early ‘bot’, we had optimised the 60-page form down to 40 pages.</p><p>But we suddenly had a realisation:</p><p>‘the form is the problem’</p><p>​Too long for simple cases, too short for the really complex, the form needed to be taken out of focus.</p><p>How could we understand the demand? The opportunity to create value?</p><p>Everything that was being done to ‘optimise efficiency’, the form and workflow, and optimise the use of the time of the experts was actually creating work.</p><p>People looked on the web or phoned up and got a bit confused; they made an application, but usually got it wrong and provide the wrong information.</p><p>But they submitted it online or it was scanned at reception, then it went into a workflow Document Management System were it could eventually be seen by a highly-trained expert.</p><p>I won’t go into what they then did to make their figures look good, or the cycling-back once the form was actually studied and we realised the citizen had provided the wrong information.</p><p>To provide a quality service, what’s critical is really understanding the need — the opportunity to create value — quickly, upfront — and, most importantly, correctly.</p><p>Most organisations, acting on seemingly rational, logical ideas which are based on the idea ‘we will know what the customer/citizen needs, and we know how to add value’.</p><p>The answer was, of course, to remove the form — and instead ask the question ‘how can we reliably learn’ those things.</p><h3>Where have you seen organisations put a ‘form’ in the way of understanding?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5b93a60467e8" width="1" height="1" alt="">
