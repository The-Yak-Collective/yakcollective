<p>The things that have been handed down to you — source obscure — and just become part of your understanding, your practice in your work?</p><p>Every profession has them, things that just form the background of your work, which feel like yours, or just ‘in the air’ — but which have their own history.</p><p>For facilitators and trainers, this is usually something built into the way you plan workshops, engage, interact.</p><p>Or it could be an updated version of a scratchy .ppt graphic you got in your first job.</p><p>That PowerPoint slide was probably copied without attribution from an OHP transparency film.</p><p>Before the film, it might have been projected on an actual slide from a slide projector… and before that, perhaps chalked on a blackboard.<br>it’s a clue when you see — or own — several different versions of what’s often quite a bad diagram.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/932/1*GiAd3sisN-khZJwiLmQWkA.png" /></figure><p>I was reminded of this the other day when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAiNsVQBBfHLP-z7gMQuYqQhIVrRm3SzwFM">Keith🍏 Amoss PhD PCC</a> said, about one of my slides, “I believe that’s good old Betari’s Box ( although no one really knows who he was) isn’t it?”<br>It was (see slide three) — I knew it must have *some* source, but I’d never looked — I had inherited it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/952/1*6ihnF2ipVj5xjSVFok4TsQ.png" /></figure><p>The Double Diamond is a lot like this for most people (there’s a complex history to it — see <a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/05/05/the-double-diamond-as-an-example-of-some-challenges-of-attribution-in-the-history-of-ideas/">https://chosen-path.org/2021/05/05/the-double-diamond-as-an-example-of-some-challenges-of-attribution-in-the-history-of-ideas/</a>).</p><p>The facilitraining rainbow, itself, is a lot like this — though we know that comes from The Facilitator’s Pocketbook by John Townsend and Paul Donovan, and was originally drawn by Phi Halstone.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/968/1*rm6IgP7Lo6AWVskropKM_g.png" /></figure><p>Other ones for me are:<br>- Various learning cycles and PDCA / CAP-Do (see Deming’s original OHP, citing Shewhart)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/671/1*kZrnm2eXaTM4NY8zICbMjQ.png" /></figure><ul><li>The idea of ‘holding space’ and of differentiation and integration as a group</li><li>The ‘problem solving team build’, which I was handed on a prompt card as part of my PWC Lean Six Sigma Black Belt course.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nZIAKEA0Sldni1T9hoVhgw.png" /></figure><ul><li>‘Let’s split into trios’</li><li>The image of lean as a stream — disrupted or smooth…</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*Tj6ixi7KyHZzV5RZBxxp4w.png" /></figure><ul><li>The left hand column exercise</li><li>‘Getting the whole system in the room…’</li></ul><h3><strong>&gt;&gt; What are yours? &lt;&lt;</strong></h3><p>_____________</p><p>SO many of these things go back to just a few people, in the 20s or post-war. Elliot Jaques. Warren Bennis. Lillian Gilbreth.</p><p>Very often the sources suggested by Google are, somehow, in a pdf about school leadership.</p><p>Many turn out to feature in The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook…</p><p>For me, the tracking down and properly citing, the paying respects to where these ideas come from, is a valuable (if time-consuming) activity.</p><p>You might also find — like Mehrabian’s 7–38–55 communication model, like Maslow’s ‘hierarchy of needs’, and so many other things we learned on the knee of jaded, facetious trainers as youngsters — that they are bunk: old canards which need to be let go.</p><p>If we know a bit more about where our ideas come from, we will know more about how to use them effectively…</p><p>_____________</p><h3>You mean it’s not really my idea then?<br>🌏 never was 🔫</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=edf6ca84d13e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
