<h3>Transaction costs do not predict systems costs</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E4ccexjY2R9Yd_z_onLWDA.png" /></figure><p>If you wanted to predict how many customer contacts a council would have, and how much they cost, what factor do you think would best predict?</p><ul><li>Population?</li><li>Number of people in poverty?</li><li>Geographic size?</li><li>Housing stock?</li></ul><p>Spoiler: NOTHING reliably predicts total numbers of contacts and cost.<br> <br>THE PHONE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*RK2jjPlZ-5z4pZLQ.png" /></figure><p>It’s the design of the system of receiving demand and dealing with it which is the major factor which drives numbers of contacts and costs.<br> <br>It’s like a Hendrix gig — the feedback is dominating the signal.</p><p>For a while, we offered a benchmarking service where councils could — with a bit of work — gather together and compare their volumes of contacts across different ‘contact channels’ for different services.<br> <br>Not ‘you’re in the top quartile — congratulations!’<br> <br>Serious analytics and to show where to investigate and what to think about to make improvements and savings.<br> <br>Still somewhat crude, but valuable.<br> <br>One thing we did discover quite clearly: as digital channel contact went up… so did telephone contact, in an apparently-linked pattern.</p><p>Lack of ability to absorb demand, we assume — and also the curse of ‘generic email addresses’.<br> <br>But when we ran regression analysis to try to control for predictable factors that drive contact, it broke the system.<br> <br>Not population or geographic size, not number of council houses, proportion of people with disabilities, not numbers of people with social care needs.<br> <br>The design of the system is governing the demand on the system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lYuleRf60mZ2JUiW2eRGqQ.png" /></figure><p>I once presented to a council finance director on transforming their customer contact model, really working to get it right first time. He was a rather over-caffeinated and red-faced individual, and turned positively puce when he responded. <strong>“All we’re doing with this ‘customer care’ nonsense, Benjamin, is FARMING A COMMUNITY OF NUTCASES!”</strong></p><p>He was so wrong, but also so right; failed organisation farm their own demand.</p><ul><li>They fail to get it right first time.</li><li>They create chaotic ‘signposting’</li><li>They break one need into multiple appointments.</li><li>They make matters worse.</li><li>They generate complaints and more needs.</li></ul><h3>What examples can you think of, of organisations generating their own demand?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6d71aea4fabe" width="1" height="1" alt="">
