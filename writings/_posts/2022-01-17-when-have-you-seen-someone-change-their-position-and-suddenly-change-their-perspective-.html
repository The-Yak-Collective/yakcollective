<h3>When have you seen someone change their position — and suddenly change their perspective?</h3><h3>The arrogant superstar suddenly brought low? The ardent Trade Unionist promoted to manager?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MeTxUKYHAlkxTDRkpnVN4Q.png" /></figure><p>The contract manager for the contact centre was at breaking point.</p><p>‘Those bastards! We told them about this change three weeks ago. They haven’t trained, they haven’t resourced, they’re blaming the service, and I know they’re going to use this as an excuse at the monthly performance review meeting — even thought I’m sure they’re fiddling the figures too. I’ll have that contact centre director’s guts for garters!’</p><p>Sure enough, in the end the director was eventually fired by the supplier, (though now I am doubting myself whether he actually used that colourful Tudor phrase).</p><p><em>(In fact, this is a cunning tactic of outsourcers. They land a big deal, bank the annual income, then install a ‘relationship manager’ with compensation based entirely on upselling new services. As a consequence, resource is directed away from the bread-and-butter work, which naturally deteriorates.</em></p><p><em>When enough anger is being generated to jeopardise additional sell-on to that client, and they’re on the edge of contractual performance penalties, the corporate centre swoops in, and takes decisive action by firing the relationship manager.</em></p><p><em>In comes the new relationship manager, able to talk refreshingly honestly about the prior poor performance, be open about the horrifying ‘slackness’ they’ve discovered, and pledge a new broom to start afresh with a clean slate.</em></p><p><em>And a new set of upselling targets.)</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/543/1*1KVvcMYc9QIHF43Sz-4hzQ.png" /></figure><p>Six months later, I heard through the grapevine that there was a new outsourced contact centre director — and it was the former council contract manager!</p><p>I gave him a call. ‘Those bastards in the services just made a dozen process changes at the busiest time of year, they didn’t inform me, and they won’t properly resource the additional shifts I’m having to field. The absolute sods!’</p><p>He wasn’t being ironic: in the blink of an eye, his perspective had changed 180 degrees.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-rKmINOpwG9CZAxBT6fQDw.png" /></figure><h3>Have you ever experienced this perspective change, when your context changes?
