<p>Over winter break, <a href="http://www.raphdamico.com/">Raph D’Amico</a> helped me refresh Story Synth’s look and feel. You can check it out at <a href="https://storysynth.org/">storysynth.org</a> – I love how it turned out!</p>

<p>First up, there’s a sharp new logo:</p>

<p>We gave the homepage a complete redesign and it looks much more modern and professional than the previous iteration. The new styling carries over to the Gallery page and the new <a href="https://storysynth.org/Formats/">Formats</a> page.</p>

<p>Finally, we redesigned the in-game “session” pages. The previous and next buttons now float alongside the cards on big screens, and underneath on small screens. All the other buttons now live in a menu modal, accessible from the top of the screen. This is a huge improvement over the cluttered look of the old interface.</p>

<p>Collaborating with Raph on this redesign was a massive treat for me. His process, design sensibilities, keen eye, and deft CSS skills made all the difference – every step was a complete delight!</p>
