<h2 id="idor-introduction">IDOR Introduction</h2>
<p>IDOR = Insecure Direct Object Reference</p>
<p>Basically, this is when a user’s access isn’t properly checked before displaying a resource. Think of all of those examples where (once authenticated) simply changing a URL parameter is enough to expose sensitive data</p>
<h2 id="forced-browsing-introduction">Forced Browsing Introduction</h2>
<p>Forced browsing is basically a species of IDOR (except that often you don’t even need to be authenticated). But in this case we’re just guessing (or brute forcing) URL paths to access server resources.</p>
<p>(The reason I’m maintaining that forced browsing and IDOR are basically equivalent is that URL paths are kinda arbitrary, and are often actually parameterized commands rather than literal paths these days. The difference between a URL parameter and the URL path is mostly just semantics in practice.)</p>
<h2 id="forced-browsing-automatic-exploitation">Forced Browsing Automatic Exploitation</h2>
<p>wfuzz is a URL fuzzer – basically the command-line version of the Burp Suite Intruder (but it’s <em>much</em> faster, which is what one would generally expect from a command-line tool).</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code> - Use color</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-z</code> - Specify the wordlist that will replace FUZZ in the request</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the word “FUZZ” in the URL will be replaced by elements of the wordlist specified by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-z</code>. Multiple slots can be specified using “FUZ2Z”, “FUZ3Z”, etc.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wfuzz <span class="nt">-z</span> file,rockyou.txt https://example.com/FUZZ/img/secret.jpg
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wfuzz --help</code> for a full list of options. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--hc 404</code> option is particularly useful for hiding pages that return a 404.</p>

<h2 id="api-bypass-exploitation">API Bypass Exploitation</h2>
<p>Basically, the idea here is that sometimes APIs (especially non-public ones!) are sloppy about checking user authentication or permissions. This is generally harder to work with than fuzzing a website directly (since you’re often “flying blind” when experimenting with the API), but can be even more powerful.</p>
