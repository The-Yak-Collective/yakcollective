<h3>Thriving in the space of service — for consultants, coaches, facilitators, business partners…</h3><h3>Have you ever been asked to help, and ended up feeling abused and misused? Why did it go that way?</h3><p>Whether you’re part of a bunch of #consultants dealing with a #management issue, a coach, mentor, a friend, an HR or Finance Business Partner, or leading a radical #innovation process to help them to be fit for the #future — why does it end so disappointingly, so often?</p><p>There is a systemic pull for your good advice to… just be ignored.</p><p>The likelihood is that you’ll end up frustrated and disappointed: ‘if only they’d listened to me!’</p><p>And your ‘client’ will end up thinking: ‘they seemed pretty good, but their advice just didn’t land’.</p><p>Why?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/752/1*g4gsjaUwCxohCWn_TxuvuA.png" /></figure><p>It’s because any time you seek to advise someone, two conditions pertain:</p><p>1- they know more than you do!</p><p>about their situation, the nuances, the issues, their desires and preferences and the history</p><p>2- you are vulnerable</p><p>as someone coming in as the ‘expert helper’, it might seem that you have more power. But they’ve asked you in, they can let you go at any time, and *they* will be the one judging your success or failure.</p><p>Faced with this vulnerability, there is an instant instinctive pull which tends to take people in one of two directions.</p><p>Not always, not every time, but persistently and with great reliability, ‘helpers’ assume one of two roles:</p><h3><strong>THE EXPERT</strong></h3><p>Cloaked with my great mantle of wisdom, I descend upon you and guarantee that, if you just follow my prescription, all will be well with your world…</p><p>(As long as your circumstances fit my mental schema, you’re capable of carrying it out, and you actually want what my prescription will give you!)</p><p>This is the defensiveness of power — storing up the excuse that the help didn’t work because ‘they just didn’t listen to me’.</p><p>or</p><h3><strong>THE SERVANT</strong></h3><p>“Always obedient to your grace’s will, I come to know your pleasure” says Angelo to the Duke in Measure for Measure.</p><p>In conditions of uncertainty and vulnerability — well, make yourself useful!</p><p>This is the defensiveness of powerlessness — storing up the excuse that the help didn’t work ‘even though I did everything they asked of me’.</p><p>Both of these modes try to deny the vulnerability of being a helper.</p><p>Both try to keep the superiority of the helper safe.</p><p>What’s the alternative? Well, join the <a href="https://bit.ly/RQtoolshedshowandtell">RedQuadrant tool shed</a> and find out! More, as they say, in the comments…</p><p>…but actually, the answer is to embrace the vulnerability.</p><p>Clearly state the facts: ‘I have some expertise that might help here. And you know your context better than I do. Let’s learn about your situation and options together, and see if you can get somewhere better’.</p><p>Notice that this stance *resists the urge to be of immediate value*.</p><p>It *prolongs* the vulnerability, it accentuates it.</p><p>This is what Barry Oshry calls ‘developing a co-learning relationship when you’re in the space of service’. And Peter Block calls ‘holding 50/50 responsibility’ in Flawless Consulting.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/898/1*Rjy7Pn-N4ItB29dc5Cazbw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/963/1*hyhoa-_HPI_e4TY0Pwdw2w.png" /><figcaption>Barry Oshry — the Space of Service</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/758/1*gNTiDa_3hfd1tUsfHa0ouQ.png" /><figcaption>Peter Block — Flawless Consulting</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>When have you been in the ‘space of service’?
