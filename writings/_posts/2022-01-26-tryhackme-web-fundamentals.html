<h3 id="sql-injection">SQL Injection</h3>
<p>Three things to remember when attempting SQLi:</p>
<ul>
<li>When injecting code, you’ll <em>often</em> want to end with a trailing “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> --</code>” (space-dash-dash) in order to <em>comment out</em> the remainder or the line you’re injecting into.</li>
<li>Remember that the canonical SQL injection “test” is “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' or 1 = 1 --'</code>” (close out the user data input, insert condition that’s always true, and comment out the rest of the command). But, of course sometimes there might be a quoting difference, and sometimes you might want a <em>false</em> statement (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and 1 = 0</code>), and sometimes commenting out the remainder of the statement will break things…</li>
<li>You don’t necessarily know <em>how</em> user inputs are going to be processed on the backend. Sometimes its one query. Sometimes it’s multiple queries. This means that you sometimes need to inject SQL into <em>multiple</em> fields (particularly when trying to subvert a login).</li>
</ul>
