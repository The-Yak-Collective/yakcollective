<p>I’m in the process of building a website and community for games that explore the future.</p>

<p>We’re still in the early days of foresight games being used within organizations. I think we’ll see accelerating adoption in the coming years as we hear more success stories and see more games created. My aim is to encourage more organizations to incorporate foresight games into their work and to help more game designers succeed in the space.</p>

<p>The site will be at <a href="https://foresight.games">Foresight.Games</a> and it will likely include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Foresight.Games website with information on related games, game designers, consultants, and facilitators</li>
  <li>A community hub, likely in Slack or Discord</li>
  <li>A series of events, including talks, workshops, and playtests</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in participating or learning more, <a href="https://forms.gle/6jiW5fsgRUiBhySK9">fill out this form</a> and I’ll reach out with more info.</p>
