<p>It’s absolutely critical to work with the voluntary, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=community&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6894566555565256704">#community</a>, and social enterprise sector if we’re going to achieve anything with ‘<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=levellingup&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6894566555565256704">#levellingup</a>’.</p><p>What do you think is most important to enable this and transform our communities and our lives for the better?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/428/1*WFzv1c-q205hJLlazLz43g.png" /></figure><p>As well as the brilliant work we do at the <a href="http://www.publicservicetransformation.org/">Public Service Transformation Academy</a> to build capacity for commissioning and transformation, we’re currently working on behalf of the LGA on a project to provide structured support to adult social care commissioners to develop their strategic approach.</p><p>If you’d like to share your experience or ideas to inform a free, open, local-government-wide tool and learning community, we are interested in hearing from all parties.</p><p>There are several different ways that you could get involved. We are looking for interviewees, case studies and focus group attendees.</p><p>We are also planning to create an open learning community. This will meet for the first time on the afternoon of Wednesday 9 February and will meet fortnightly on four more occasions.</p><p>If you are interested in getting involved, please contact David Mason at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=david.mason@publicservicetransformation.org">david.mason@publicservicetransformation.org</a>, 07887 442487</p><p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=future&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6894566555565256704">#future</a> of our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=society&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6894566555565256704">#society</a> depends on our engagement with civil society.</p><p>Yesterday I was lucky enough to chair a conference: Transforming Commissioning: Levelling Up and Community Investment.</p><p><a href="http://www.govtransformation.org/think-piece/commissioning-community-and-levelling-up-a-critical-moment/">My fuller notes are here.</a></p><p>I got so many rich, crisp, clear points from it:</p><ul><li>competition is a power tool for commissioners — useful but incredibly dangerous. It should be retired from being thought of as ‘the only tool’</li><li>we have a fragmented civil society, especially where it’s most needed</li><li>if you designed a system of funding and support to stop us getting the benefits, it would look like what we’ve got</li></ul><p>Money spent on community, voluntary, and social enterprise organisations:</p><ul><li>gets re-spent locally more than any other money</li><li>goes *right* where it’s needed for ‘levelling up’</li><li>generates better communities</li><li>is the *only* way economic regeneration can work</li><li>creates extra benefits and results (£3.20 back within the first ten years)</li><li>is especially valuable if directed to minoritised communities</li></ul><p>There’s huge evidence for this, now built in to Treasury evaluation models — and we need to feature strong evidence, powerful stories, and unique grassroots insights to make the case</p><p>At heart, this is about relationships — building better relationships, challenge, and governance capacity locally — to change the system from fragmented, costly mess to supportive coherence. And making sure that politicians and civil servants experience this for themselves.</p><p>The only way to do this is to see public services and commissioning as equal citizens, an influential part of a complex system, working together to focus on what actually matters for citizens and communities.</p><p>We all want to ‘level up’. We all want to live in thriving, positive communities — where every child has *amazing* life chances.</p><p>What do you think we need to change to achieve that?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ee6bf52b539c" width="1" height="1" alt="">
