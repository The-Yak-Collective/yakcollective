<h3>Have you ever been taken for a mug? Lied to, manipulated?</h3><p>We hired someone into an important #management position, with financial responsibilities.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zKkB827yRRut_p45Vcg1Qg.png" /></figure><p>They aced all the #jobinterviews. Had great references, an engaging style. Perhaps a bit too ‘matey’, something off. But they were from a visible, minoritised group, and shared a lot about their upbringing and life, very different from ours. It felt potentially prejudicial to judge.</p><p>Things went OK, for a while. They took a lot on, took responsibility out of our hands as leaders and owners. Some people felt quite uncomfortable with them… but, again, that could be prejudice, right?</p><p>And they were going through some family things, and potentially a divorce — we thought of their poor, cute little kid!</p><p>One day, I came back to the office unexpectedly early, and decided to open the admin post while going upstairs, instead of just handing it over.</p><p>They had been drawing the maximum cash on the company charge card. Every. Single. Day.</p><p>The discovery was traumatic, stressful.</p><p>The police were helpful, at first.</p><p>They made the arrest.</p><p>The legal process, I’m sorry to say, was in some ways the most traumatic of all. Especially the bit where the police at the court held us in a small room so we couldn’t tell the judge that the Crown Prosecution Service was agreeing a plea deal based on completely fake ‘facts’ — and the barrister was late and not briefed.</p><p>But, of course, the worst of it was being betrayed.</p><p>Being taken for a mug.</p><p>*Being* a mug.</p><p>Lots more came out when we investigated.</p><p>Photoshopped receipts.</p><p>Manipulative messages to team members.</p><p>All the references were fake.</p><p>The family history, the life story and drama we’d sympathised over — no reason to believe any of it was true.</p><p>And it seemed that plans were potentially being made to take a lot more money.</p><p>It’s embarrassing, isn’t it? It feels almost shameful.</p><p>But of course this is a clickbait-y title, because I think *everyone* has had this experience.</p><p>I think we need to talk about it more.</p><p>When I did, when I overcame my shame and shared with my group of chief executives of #startups, when I spoke to #humanresources professionals — everyone had a story to share. One I’d never heard before.</p><p>The roommate who was a pathological liar.</p><p>The finance officer who had stolen millions.</p><p>The assistant who’d cooked the books.</p><p>I have to say, I wish I’d heard before!</p><p>There are some people like that out there and — especially in #entrepreneurship, I’m afraid — we all come across them occasionally.</p><p>They don’t announce themselves.</p><p>So financial controls (in particular), and other ethical controls need to be built not for ordinary, reasonable, moderately ethical folks — but with awareness of the existence of such people.</p><p>I don’t know why sociopaths and moral failings are coming to mind at the moment, but look out for these people. Plan for them. Don’t give them power.</p><h3><strong>Does this ring true? Or was my case unusual?</strong></h3><p>I’m sorry to say that my own profession (management consultancy — let’s leave public services aside for now!) has had a lot more than its fair share of sociopathic company behaviour:</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=scandals+in+management+consultancy">https://www.google.com/search?q=scandals+in+management+consultancy</a></p><p>An important piece here about how sociopaths destroy ‘scenes’</p><p><a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths</a></p><p>A real warning:</p><p>An excellent FT piece about how those who most belief that corruption is a personal issue — and they are above it — are most at risk of being corrupted.</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/057203f9-23d2-4b42-b50a-dc4071759679">https://www.ft.com/content/057203f9-23d2-4b42-b50a-dc4071759679</a></p><p>I should say that in my article I was trying to avoid psychological labels — even though ‘pathological’, of course, is one — as that tends to take us down a path which is about the individual, fascinating as that may be — the point I want to make is that this is more common than we see — and that if we discuss it more (however painful), we as a society and as individuals and as institutions can defend against it better)</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b9e3fe703d40" width="1" height="1" alt="">
