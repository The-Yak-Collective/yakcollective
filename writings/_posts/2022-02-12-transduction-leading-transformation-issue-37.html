All play moves and has its being within a playground marked off beforehand either materially or ideally, deliberately or as a matter of course. Just as there is no formal difference between play and ritual, so the “consecrated spot” cannot be formally distinguished from the playground. The arena, the card table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis courts, the court of justice, etc, are all in form and function playgrounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/amateuradam/status/1490394034900197388?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Adam Kay on Twitter: “A quick thread on in the importance of being careful what data you share — even if you’re the Queen.”</a></h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/amateuradam/status/1490394034900197388">twitter.com</a></p><p>Today, Her Maj tweeted this lovely picture, gor bless er, etc. You might think that the contents of the red box would be official business.

The talk is ostensibly about game design and marketing, but it also doubles as a sort of metamodernism 101 and is largely concerned with the topic of sincere-irony. What’s interesting for me is the way it takes up this topic: it is neither an attempt at detached cultural analysis, nor does it present a world-historical vision — it is focused rather on the far more nuts and bolts realm of product design. The fundamental question it is addresses is what can be done with sincere-irony, on the small and personal scales, and in this respect it is an extremely instructive example of how this is supposed to work in practice.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*7PIZ6zz2haOs4VGJ" /></figure><p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-01-uncovers-evidence-long-term-directionality-human.html?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_content=buffer802f6&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>Study uncovers first evidence of long-term directionality in origination of human mutation, challenging neo-Darwinism</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-01-uncovers-evidence-long-term-directionality-human.html?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer802f6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><strong>phys.org</strong></a> <br> A new study by a team of researchers from Israel and Ghana has brought the first evidence of nonrandom mutation in human genes, challenging a core assumption at the heart of evolutionary theory by showing a long-term directional mutational response to environmental pressure. Using a novel method, researchers led by Professor Adi Livnat from the University of Haifa showed that the rate of generation of the HbS mutation, which protects against malaria, is higher in people from Africa, where malaria is endemic, than in people from Europe, where it is not.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/antlerboy/status/1490631602493345795?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">@antlerboy on Twitter ‘Famous people’ I’ve met… I have two fakes in here :-D</a></h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/antlerboy/status/1490631602493345795">twitter.com</a></p><p>- PMS Hacker</p><p>- Dexter Fletcher</p><p>- Dido</p><p>- The King of Serbia</p><p>- Andrew Weatherall</p><p>- Archbishop Desmond Tutu</p><p>- Sheridan Westlake</p><p>- Arthur Scargill</p><p>- Andy Swiss</p><p>- Baron Adonis</p><p>- Finlay Quaye</p><p>- Tony Benn</p><p>- Jarvis Cocker</p><p>- Pooka</p><p>- Boris Johnson</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*Bs5F-rUwx_nDS687" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10481065/amp/Flat-West-Country-takeaway-home-761-Chinese-firms-money-laundering-fears-mount.html?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>Flat above a West Country takeaway is home to 761 Chinese firms as money-laundering fears mount</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10481065/amp/Flat-West-Country-takeaway-home-761-Chinese-firms-money-laundering-fears-mount.html"><strong>www.dailymail.co.uk</strong></a> <br> REVEALED: The flat above a West Country takeaway that is home to 761 Chinese firms — and fraudsters are suspected of registering more than 11,000 companies in the UK in the past year</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/antlerboy/status/1490767339826073604?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Benjamin P.
