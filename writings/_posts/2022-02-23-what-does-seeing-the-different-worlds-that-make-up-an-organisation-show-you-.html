And so on.</p><p>- The way that worlds tend to drift apart more and more into their own universe, with leaders looking at their flawed data and pulling levers that send signals that make no sense to the organisation.</p><p>And this can create full-on schismogenesis — as the worlds (or their ‘sensemaking’) float apart, it turns into Othering ‘those idiots in operations’ or ‘those psychopaths in management’, and sometimes low-level warfare.</p><p>- Even between individuals, knowing that you’re interacting with someone in a completely different world, with different pressures and expectations, helps you see that it’s systemic and not personal, and be more tactical and strategic in trying to interact with them productively.</p><p><strong><em>If you apply the ‘different worlds’ to a system you are a part of, what interesting things can you see?</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hPjIOO6WPxKplVwK" /></figure><p>For those interested in the background details, this formulation is inspired by the viable systems model, though it grew from a ‘three worlds’ model I developed back in about 2003, partly inspired by the standard Vanguard Consulting speech. It was then informed by Barry Oshry’s power+systems model and the Viable Systems Model itself, and came together in a prototype form in early slides for the Cabinet Office Commissioning Academy, and was significantly advanced by collaboration with these good folks on a RedQuadrant bid in 2016: Jane Searles, Rob Worth, Arthur Battram, Philip Hellyer, Pauline Roberts, and Russell Gundry.</p><p>Oh, and if you’d like to see me talk about this and talk it over, join us at 5:30pm GMT:<br><a href="https://www.meetup.com/sensemaking-rs/events/283626716/">https://www.meetup.com/sensemaking-rs/events/283626716/</a> with host <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAfDZN4B--EHC_rRVDPqIM4QsqHMIeRUpyA">Novi Milenkovic</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cb25cb4eea49" width="1" height="1" alt="">
