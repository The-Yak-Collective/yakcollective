 A recent report by the global business strategists Boston Consulting Group and the World Economic Forum has found global government procurement is responsible for 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Their study reported that governments spend $11trillion(USD) annually-or 15% of global GDP, on procurement every year. Our own prior study, tracked the value of global procurement at $13 Trillion(USD) per year, suggesting that the greenhouse gas emissions could be even higher than the BCG findings.
