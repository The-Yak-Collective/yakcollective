<p>For many years, a favourite exercise of our is what we call ‘the Obolensky game’ — because we learned it from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAN1GQBt5rsagmgeOHBfKeCXqYFfWnhxiE">Nick Obolensky</a> and his book ‘Complex Adaptive <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=leadership&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6904697100676739072">#Leadership</a>’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-G7EA0Yh7rqWFoVK" /></figure><p>It is in fact, I think, a classic of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=systemsthinking&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6904697100676739072">#systemsthinking</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=complexity&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6904697100676739072">#complexity</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=cybernetics&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6904697100676739072">#cybernetics</a> genre — various called ‘the triangle game’ and something like ‘assassins and shields’ — you can google Nick or me or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACLWXMBQmQeV-YxWfMrEQkcUCOg5xSKcVA">Dennis Vergne</a> taking participants through the game on YouTube if you like.</p><p>You simply get a group of people into a defined space.</p><p>You tell them<br>‘look around the room and silently pick two people to be your ‘anchors’. Do not let them know or indicate to them in any way.<br>In a minute, I’m going to ask you to organise yourselves as a group. I need the room to end up with every person *equidistant* from their two anchor people — so each of them is the same distance from you.<br>Don’t stand right between them — things will get very cosy, very fast.<br>Instead, *triangulate* — put yourself at the top of a triangle, and have them as the other two points, the same distance from you.<br>You’re going to move carefully, safely, and — and this is important — in total silence.<br>No communication of any kind. Just move around until the system is set up with everyone equidistant from their town anchors.<br>Now, how long do you think it will take to settle?’</p><p>People will guess: ‘never’, ‘an hour’, ‘ten minutes’. Well, try it for yourself, but you’ll see it’s a lot faster than that.</p><p>It’s elegant, wonderful — self-organisation!</p><p>And you can go in and move some people around, and let the system come back to balance — it works time and time again.</p><p>(Except, for reasons we have never understood, in France. And, for reasons that are perhaps more explicable, in the NHS it ‘works’, but everyone cheats!)</p><p>You can even ask ‘what if I appointed a project manager and asked them to organise the same setup — how long would it take then?’</p><p>Everyone will appreciate that that would take *significantly* longer.</p><p>But, let’s be clear, this is not self-organising. Or, if so, it’s ‘within boundaries’.</p><p>In fact, it is a system where organisation is designed elegantly into roles and structures.</p><p>It depends on</p><p>- the authority given to the facilitator (like being in an organisation or not) — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=leadership&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6904697100676739072">#leadership</a>! :-O</p><p>- the dynamic between the leader and the team — trust, respect.<br>If I facilitate and ask a person with visual impairment to participate, in silence and without aid, my authority won’t last for long.</p><p>- questions and answers, clarification and ‘seeing as’, so everyone *actually* knows how to participate</p><p>- the willingness and competence of participants to play their roles</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2Xuv_koE6ccjyn-F" /></figure><p>So (I owe this insight to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADg3GIB7hEOP0g2w4W_B7AEqUKOGSJ4hEo">Peter Cooper</a>) we’re seeing the setting up of a leadership system with perfect boundaries and discretion for the task in hand.</p><p><strong><em>Many examples of self-organisation are actually elegantly organised systems, with leaders, authorities, trust, boundaries and freedoms? So what?</em></strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=74f3a12a6f0a" width="1" height="1" alt="">
