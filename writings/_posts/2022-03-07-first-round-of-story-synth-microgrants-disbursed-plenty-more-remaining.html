<p>About a month ago, we launched the <a href="https://blog.randylubin.com/story-synth-grant-program">Story Synth Microgrant Program</a>, administered by Big Bad Con. This past week, we accepted the first round of applicants and issued 31 microgrants for $9,300 total. I loved seeing the pitches come in and am excited to help these designers make their games.</p>

<p>I’m holding office hours this Wednesday (March 9th) from 5-6pm PST and the grant administrators will be there too. You’re welcome to attend whether you’ve been awarded a grant, are thinking of applying, or are just curious. It will be in the <a href="https://discord.gg/GNaaRbz7KX">Story Synth Discord</a> – hope to see you there!</p>

<p>We’ll be accepting more applicants throughout the spring until all $30,000 is disbursed.
