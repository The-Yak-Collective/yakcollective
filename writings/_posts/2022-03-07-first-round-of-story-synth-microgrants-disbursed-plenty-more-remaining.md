About a month ago, we launched the [Story Synth Microgrant Program](https://blog.randylubin.com/story-synth-grant-program), administered by Big Bad Con. This past week, we accepted the first round of applicants and issued 31 microgrants for $9,300 total. I loved seeing the pitches come in and am excited to help these designers make their games.

I’m holding office hours this Wednesday (March 9th) from 5-6pm PST and the grant administrators will be there too. You’re welcome to attend whether you’ve been awarded a grant, are thinking of applying, or are just curious. It will be in the [Story Synth Discord](https://discord.gg/GNaaRbz7KX) – hope to see you there!

We’ll be accepting more applicants throughout the spring until all $30,000 is disbursed. If you’re interested, learn more and apply here: [https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/](https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/ "https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/")
