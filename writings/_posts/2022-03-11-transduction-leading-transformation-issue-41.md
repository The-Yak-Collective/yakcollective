Local authorities need more support to help them find suitable placements for children in foster care and children’s homes, a new report says. A market study into children’s social care by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found there is a shortage of appropriate places in children’s homes and with foster carers, which means some children are not getting the right care from their placement.
