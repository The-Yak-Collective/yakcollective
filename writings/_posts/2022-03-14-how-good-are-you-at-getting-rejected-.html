<h3>How good are you at getting rejected? What rejections have shaped you? And when are you planning on getting rejected next?</h3><p>It’s a key skill for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=innovation&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496">#innovation</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=creativity&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496">#creativity</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=entrepreneurship&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496">#entrepreneurship</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=leadership&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496">#leadership</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=selfdevelopment&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496">#selfdevelopment</a> — but it gets too little attention.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*aZEDHobagzQmGcVM" /></figure><p>A recent tweet reminded me how I got this insight from learning about Rejection Therapy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*syXm59giNMFsXhnn" /></figure><p>The theory is that our brains are fairly ‘hard wired’ to avoid rejection. The logic is clear: being rejected by your family or your tribe would, for most of human existence, have meant near-certain death.</p><p>Apparently, part of our brains therefore fears social rejection as much as death itself (and it’s certainly a major driver of literature and drama).</p><p>I’m not too keen on these sort of ‘your early ancestors did x, so a part of your brain tries to do y’ stories, myself — too many big claims and assumptions — and usually too little attention to the incredible potential of human beings to change.</p><p>But I do know that rejection hurts. That we will do almost anything to avoid it, that it can cause us to shrink and cramp and limit ourselves.</p><p>And that the cure is — to get rejected.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bN0q-7M0vo2Rv26i" /></figure><p>For me, I was helped out of some of my fears by a range of things:</p><p>- political canvassing on council estates, and doing council satisfaction surveys in shopping centres — interrupting normally people in their daily lives and asking them what they think of politicians and of organisations</p><p>- working in jobs that required me to serve, in sometimes ‘menial’ ways, and deal with ‘clients’ and ‘customers’ who didn’t care how much a job was ‘beneath me’ when they criticised</p><p>- more radical thing: trance dance, embodying spirit animals: as my teacher said, ‘very good for losing your sense of self-importance, very critical for development’</p><p>- I might add, advocating for systems | complexity | cybernetics in our world</p><p>Being rejected is GREAT — for two reasons:</p><p>1- it encourages a bit of humility, a bit of perspective — ‘huh, it seems the world doesn’t revolve around me after all?!’</p><p>2- as you get used to it — even seek it out, respond to it — you realise that being in the position to be rejected — well, that also gives you a superpower that can advance your life. The ability to be vulnerable, to put yourself out there, to ask for what you want, to push the edges.</p><p>For me, it’s a constant thing — a constant desire to avoid rejection, a constant need to keep risking it. Of course, it’s at the heart of being human.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RR0O3L95uQ74BPPi" /><figcaption>Example of a bounding box to sample a statistical distribution with an acceptance-rejection method.<br>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rejection_sampling_of_a_bounded_distribution_with_finite_support.svg</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>So, when were you last rejected? When will you next take the chance?</em></strong></p><p>The tweet that reminded me of all this was Maggie Xiao Qi Chen posting about her ‘deliberate week of rejection’ — <a href="https://twitter.com/cxqmaggie/status/1500838871281676292">https://twitter.com/cxqmaggie/status/1500838871281676292</a></p><p>The OG link is to Rejection Therapy — <a href="https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/game/rules">https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/game/rules</a></p><p>I love the objectives on that page:</p><ol><li>To be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives</li><li>Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence)</li><li>Learn from, and even enjoy rejection</li><li>To not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people</li><li>Permit yourself to fail</li></ol><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=24c674378caf" width="1" height="1" alt="">
