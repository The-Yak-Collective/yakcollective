### How good are you at getting rejected? What rejections have shaped you? And when are you planning on getting rejected next?

It’s a key skill for [#innovation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=innovation&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496), [#creativity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=creativity&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496), [#entrepreneurship](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=entrepreneurship&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496), [#leadership](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=leadership&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496), [#selfdevelopment](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=selfdevelopment&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909044314480234496) — but it gets too little attention.

A recent tweet reminded me how I got this insight from learning about Rejection Therapy.

The theory is that our brains are fairly ‘hard wired’ to avoid rejection. The logic is clear: being rejected by your family or your tribe would, for most of human existence, have meant near-certain death.

Apparently, part of our brains therefore fears social rejection as much as death itself (and it’s certainly a major driver of literature and drama).

I’m not too keen on these sort of ‘your early ancestors did x, so a part of your brain tries to do y’ stories, myself — too many big claims and assumptions — and usually too little attention to the incredible potential of human beings to change.

But I do know that rejection hurts. That we will do almost anything to avoid it, that it can cause us to shrink and cramp and limit ourselves.

And that the cure is — to get rejected.

For me, I was helped out of some of my fears by a range of things:

- political canvassing on council estates, and doing council satisfaction surveys in shopping centres — interrupting normally people in their daily lives and asking them what they think of politicians and of organisations

- working in jobs that required me to serve, in sometimes ‘menial’ ways, and deal with ‘clients’ and ‘customers’ who didn’t care how much a job was ‘beneath me’ when they criticised

- more radical thing: trance dance, embodying spirit animals: as my teacher said, ‘very good for losing your sense of self-importance, very critical for development’

- I might add, advocating for systems | complexity | cybernetics in our world

Being rejected is GREAT — for two reasons:

1- it encourages a bit of humility, a bit of perspective — ‘huh, it seems the world doesn’t revolve around me after all?!’

2- as you get used to it — even seek it out, respond to it — you realise that being in the position to be rejected — well, that also gives you a superpower that can advance your life. The ability to be vulnerable, to put yourself out there, to ask for what you want, to push the edges.

For me, it’s a constant thing — a constant desire to avoid rejection, a constant need to keep risking it. Of course, it’s at the heart of being human.

**_So, when were you last rejected? When will you next take the chance?_**

The tweet that reminded me of all this was Maggie Xiao Qi Chen posting about her ‘deliberate week of rejection’ — [https://twitter.com/cxqmaggie/status/1500838871281676292](https://twitter.com/cxqmaggie/status/1500838871281676292)

The OG link is to Rejection Therapy — [https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/game/rules](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/game/rules)

I love the objectives on that page:

1. To be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives
2. Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence)
3. Learn from, and even enjoy rejection
4. To not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people
5. Permit yourself to fail
