<h1 id="comptia-security-exam-cram">CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram</h1>
<p>Today it’s chapter 15 of the Security+ Exam Cram, “Physical Security Controls”.</p>
<p>A recurring theme here is to consider security measures based on whether you’re trying to monitor <em>access</em> or prevent <em>theft</em> (or both).</p>
<h2 id="signs-fencing-and-gates">Signs, Fencing, and Gates</h2>
<p>6’ - 7’ in most situations, 8’ topped with barbed wire or razor wire for particularly high security areas.</p>
<p>“Hybrid gates” include both a card reader or keypad <em>and</em> staff who can further verify visitor identity before opening the gate.</p>
<h2 id="lighting">Lighting</h2>
<p>Use lighting with a high “color rendering index” - a measure of how faithfully lighting mimics the colors perceived in daylight (clear sunlight is defined as having a color rendering index of 100, the highest value). Light sources with more continuous spectra and that more accurately mimic blackbody radiation have higher color rendering indexes.</p>
<p>Twice-yearly inspection of exterior lighting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index">Color rendering index (Wikipedia)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="barricades-and-bollards">Barricades and Bollards</h2>
<p>A “bollard” is one of those short posts designed to prevent vehicle access while allowing pedestrian access.</p>
<h2 id="internal-security">Internal Security</h2>
<p>Role-based access control is commonly used for granting internal access.</p>
<h2 id="motion-and-infrared-detection">Motion and Infrared Detection</h2>
<p>Infrared detection systems come in two varieties: Active (“trip” beams) and passive (heat source detection).</p>
<h2 id="access-control-vestibules">Access Control Vestibules</h2>
<p>Mantraps!</p>
<h2 id="locks-and-lock-types">Locks and Lock Types</h2>
<p>Types of locks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key locks</li>
<li>“Cipher” locks (punch codes)</li>
<li>Wireless locks (RFIDs)</li>
<li>Swipe card locks</li>
</ul>
<p>This section gets very “Sneakers”.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="equipment-security">Equipment Security</h2>
<p>Interesting stat: Laptop theft is about as common as car theft.</p>
<h2 id="cable-locks">Cable Locks</h2>
<p>The most annoying anti-theft mechanism…</p>
<h2 id="locking-cabinets-and-enclosures">Locking Cabinets and Enclosures</h2>
<p>Apparently those built-in desk cabinets where computers are sometimes stored are called… “security computer cabinets”.</p>
<p>“Locking cabinets” refers specifically to filing cabinets and the like.</p>
<h2 id="protected-cabling-protected-distribution-and-faraday-cages">Protected Cabling, Protected Distribution, and Faraday Cages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coaxial cable: Easy to tap! Does anyone actually use coax anymore?</li>
<li>Twisted pair cabling can be divided into unshielded (UTP) and shielded (STP) categories. STP can incorporate a single shield for the entire cable, or can shield each wire separately (which reduces cross-talk and makes tapping harder).</li>
<li>The “plenum” is the space between floors. Cabling run in the plenum is generally required to be more fire-resistant than regular cabling.</li>
<li>Two governmental network systems are SIPRNET (the “Secure Internet Protocol Router Network”, for classified information up to “Secret”) and NIPRNET (the “Non-Classified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network”). These use special tamper-resistant cables called “protected distribution systems” (PDS).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hvac">HVAC</h2>
<ul>
<li>HVAC: “Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning”</li>
<li>Over-cooling risks condensation.</li>
<li>Over-drying risks static discharges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fire-suppression">Fire Suppression</h2>
<p>Sprinkler systems come in two varieties: “Wet pipe” (which contain pressurized water from the get go) and “dry pipe” (which are connected to a pressurized water source, but stopped with pressurized gas in the actual sprinkler area). The reason to use a “dry pipe” system is to guard against possible pipe freezes and create a delay between when a fire is detected and when the actual water starts flowing (such a delay might allow for a chemical system to take care of the fire first, so that the sprinklers can be shut off <em>before</em> the water reaches them, thus preventing equipment damage).</p>
<p>Fire classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Wood, paper, etc. Extinguished with water.</li>
<li>B: Liquids, gasses, grease. Extinguish with a foam fire extinguisher.</li>
<li>C: Electrical fires. Extinguish with a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.</li>
<li>D: Metals. Extinguish with sodium chloride or copper powder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hot-and-cold-aisles">Hot and Cold Aisles</h2>
<p>The idea here is to arrange server racks front-to-front and back-to-back, so that cold air can be delivered to one aisle (and pulled into the servers) and hot air is exhausted to the other (and immediately pulled into exhaust ducts).</p>
<p>Humidity should be kept in the 40% - 50% range.</p>
<p>Remember the importance of running sensors on a separate network than the rest of the building and/or to use cellular connectivity. Sensors are no use if they are subject to the same forces that can degrade “normal” equipment!</p>
<h2 id="secure-data-destruction">Secure Data Destruction</h2>
<p>Media sanitization methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declassification (YOLO)</li>
<li>Degaussing (old-school media)</li>
<li>Wiping</li>
<li>Encryption (and throw away the key)</li>
<li>Physical destruction</li>
</ul>
<p>Exam Cram notes that data classification, security, and disposal guidelines are formally defined in a “sensitive information policy”.</p>
<p>Paper document disposal methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burning</li>
<li>Shredding</li>
<li>Pulping (reduction of paper back to cellulose fibers)</li>
<li>Pulverizing (turn it into dust!)</li>
</ul>

<p>From the outside-in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fencing</li>
<li>Bollards and barricades</li>
<li>Security guards and robot sentries</li>
<li>Cameras/CCTV</li>
<li>Mantraps</li>
<li>Reception (visitor logs, etc.)</li>
<li>Alarms and signs</li>
<li>Sensors (motion, noise, pressure, humidity, temperature)</li>
<li>Locks (keyed, biometric, smart cards, PIN entry, key fobs)</li>
<li>Faraday cages</li>
<li>Cable locks</li>
<li>USB data blockers (epoxy the ports!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Camera systems can be “normal” continuous feeds, motion recognition camera (which are triggered by motion), and object detection cameras (which may automatically move or focus on objects of interest).</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to make sure that wall jacks are locked down, especially in common areas!</p>
<p>Sensors are useful not just for monitoring people, but monitoring environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Two-person control is useful for any highly sensitive or irreversible high-impact operations.</p>
<p>Key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air gapped networks/systems</li>
<li>Vaults and safes (often for backups)</li>
</ul>
