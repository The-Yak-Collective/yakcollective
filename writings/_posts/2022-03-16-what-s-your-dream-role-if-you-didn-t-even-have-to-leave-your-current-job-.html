I’ve been working with the people behind Coeuraj for a few years, watching their strategic journey and supporting capability development.</p><p>They are a transformation practice that exists to build a more inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable world. They use collaborative design to confront systems at odds with the people they are intended to serve and deliver inclusive ways for groups to work together across boundaries and interests.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LgD1oszgxUjwKm0Q" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/coeuraj/">Coeuraj</a> bring together bright people, excellent methods, a clear ethical focus and genuinely interesting, challenging work.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1004/0*4GmF_cm289lzsqGb" /></figure><p>I’m going to be a part-time Transformation Lead over the next few months, joining one of the most dynamic and intelligent groups of people I’ve had the pleasure to meet. As well as delivering client work and overall support, I’m helping them to increase (even more!) their focus on learning-in-practice.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YfL-gc3tCzd78mXG" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*N60OBShvLGlw6KFf" /></figure><p>It’s an exciting opportunity to be part of something different-but-familiar, to support the evolution of a growing business with big plans and ideas and to learn together.</p><p>Pretty cool, huh?</p><p><strong><em>So — what about you?
