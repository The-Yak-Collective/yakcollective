#### Vernal Equinox Update (3/20/2022): initial launch & wayfinding equilibrium as a ‘solopreneur’

This is the first of many intended **Public Work Log** entries for [Coεmeta](https://coemeta.xyz), a Public Benefit LLC providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It is intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of [**working in public**](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to [**knowledge commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), “ **finding the others** ” & **leaving a trail + some resources** for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to reach out at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!

### 📜 Prologue: backstory & motivations

**Coεmeta** is my attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this my _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):

> a more **balanced, integrated, enriching & impactful** life in **greater community**

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka “infinitely”), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://www.notion.so/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

> (My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a [worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) or [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & partnerships with other “self-sovereign” ᵋ groups or entities. This is part of the “in greater community” aspect of the metagame, but more on that later.)

So **Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional ‘venture’ or typical small business or startup etc** , but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [⏳ Timeline](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-timeline) section recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & the [🗺 Frameworks](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-strategic-frameworks-sensemaking-planning--evaluation) section describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models I’ve used so far.

As elaborated in the full post, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So this post is part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. I hope to establish a template & cadence for these things.

ᵋ _NB: I’m generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized “_[_sovereign individuals_](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)_”, but “independent” isn’t quite adequate either._

### 🧬 Strategic Frameworks: sensemaking, planning & evaluation

As a [decision science](https://medium.com/coemeta/from-information-to-action-with-quantitative-decision-science-9752b6c969d5#4054) practitioner & general strategy nerd, I’ve seen how **the right framework can simplify, clarify & streamline the task of making sense of information & (potential) actions** — _as long as we don’t mistake the map for the territory_ ᵋ. So I’ve made ample use of various models & frameworks in the planning & execution of Coεmeta _to date_. This is a short list of the most relevant & cogent.

ᵋ …a few more obligatory **caveats** & **cautionary aphorisms** regarding models & planning:

- [“Plans are worthless, but planning is priceless”](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/)
- [“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”](https://www.commit.works/everyone-has-a-plan-until-they-get-punched-in-the-mouth/)
- ([Optionality](https://thedeepdish.org/optionality-book/) & [OODA loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) are often better than plans)
- [“All models are wrong, but some are useful”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)
- See generally: [complexity science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) & [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory), e.g. [Robert May (1976)](https://medium.com/coemeta/the-logistic-map-the-onset-of-chaos-sonified-46fd73e25965#5174)
- In fact the epsilon (“ε”) in **_Coεmeta_** is meant as a reminder of the ‘[error margin](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-communication-research-methods/i4630.xml)’ in any model, estimate or probabilistic assessment. (see further details on this etymology in the [timeline section](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-timeline))

#### Vibe Check

I’ll leave the raw scorekeeping & evaluation metrics for another update, along with a formal open-source strategy repository for proper versions of some [frameworks](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-strategic-frameworks-sensemaking-planning--evaluation) & other artifacts covered above. I wanna keep this post more narrative-based & vibey.

So speaking of vibe checks: **I feel good.**

I’ve found some of the **greater balance** I was seeking, in several areas:

- **lifestyle** (sleep, diet, activity, etc)
- **inner & outer life** (no longer perpetually socially exhausted by relentless compulsory sociality, I’m more open to voluntary sociality)
- **work-life balance** (& crucially, integration of some aspects of these, while maintaining healthy boundaries with greater autonomy)

And my more **integrated** work-life has been **more rewarding** , & **more palpably impactful** (though limited in scale & scope so far).

**It’s extremely early in the game, & there have been challenges, setbacks, looming doubts & uncertainty** , etc. I did a lot of planning & yet, predictably, things did not go exactly according to plan. But **overall things are good & the path feels right.** I look forward to continuing to shift to more of an outward focus, enabling clients & collaborators to be more impactful, & growing our mutual capacities together.

#### Exit to Infinity

**The Coεmeta journey so far has been, frankly, smoother & more successful than I probably had any right to expect**. And that is **largely due to luck, & the kindness of others**  — e.g. peers & former colleagues generously making referrals & enthusiastic endorsements (or [retweets](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1482448923658977280)) — more than anything I’ve done myself. As described above, I did a lot of [planning & strategic sensemaking](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-strategic-frameworks-sensemaking-planning--evaluation), put in the [time & effort](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-timeline) etc, but the most positive developments have all been precipitated by others, or lucky breaks.

**I don’t expect this to continue indefinitely. There will be greater challenges, feasts & famines.** Maybe there will be times when my big-brain planning frameworks produce the crucial insight or tactical adjustment which enables a great breakthrough. Maybe sheer determination & individual effort will carry the day. But I hope not. I’d rather continue to be primarily powered by the support of others, & return the favor, pay it forward & work synergistically whenever possible. And in the meantime I’ll continue wayfinding towards greater balance, integration & impact, by myself & with others.

That is the metagame, the infinite game:

> a more **balanced, integrated, enriching** & **impactful** life in **greater community**

…& for now at least, with zeal & gratitude, I’m still playing 🙏🏼
