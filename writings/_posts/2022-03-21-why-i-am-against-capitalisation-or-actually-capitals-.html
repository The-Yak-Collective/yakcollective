<p>Have you ever been in a management meeting where everyone used the jargon, but nobody had a clue what they meant?</p><p><strong>The Power of Names, part three:</strong></p><p>And for the power of names parts one and two:<br><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/06/30/the-power-of-names-part-1-why-redquadrant/">https://chosen-path.org/2021/06/30/the-power-of-names-part-1-why-redquadrant/</a><br><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/01/the-power-of-names-part-two%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8aantlerboy/">https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/01/the-power-of-names-part-two%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8aantlerboy/</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vDJXV4CZtBToYSuw" /><figcaption>Nathan W Pyle <a href="https://www.nathanwpyle.art/">www.nathanwpyle.art/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Folks in RedQuadrant know that I&#39;m a demon for seeking out and removing what our style guide calls Unnecessary Capitalisation, A Prime Cause of The Reader Stumbling.</p><p>So, &#39;council&#39; is lower case, as is borough, business process re-engineering is lower case (even in headings), business case and senior responsible officer are all lower case.</p><p>I did one tie myself up in knots and write &#39;London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham&#39;, but never mind.</p><p>We even write titles in ordinary sentence case - like finance director (the person who is the director of finance), unless we&#39;re emphasising the title like in &#39;David Hunter, Managing Director of….&#39; - because, if a job title has a meaning let&#39;s try to refer to the meaning!</p><p>And we spell out acronyms wherever possible: &#39;customer relationship management system&#39;, not &#39;CRM&#39;. customerrelations are usually anything but.</p><p>I have plenty of other exciting stylistic foibles (&#39;we&#39; and &#39;you&#39; not &#39;RedQuadrant&#39; and &#39;the Council&#39;, never use &#39;&amp;&#39;, using the &#39;Oxford comma,&#39; and so on).</p><p>But the point of this post isn&#39;t writing - it&#39;s meaning and understanding.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/694/1*QNjgUXi3xHqSIUkE9j8jcg.jpeg" /></figure><p>As soon as we Capitalise a thing - or, worse, use acronyms - we are working with the label, the name, not making an attempt to connect to the actual meaning of what we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>It&#39;s a silly thing, in some ways.</p><p>But I think it is important.</p><p>Communication is hard enough anyway, and the further we move to substitute labels for things - however convenient that actually is - the further we get from real meaning.</p><p>Of course, this doesn&#39;t go far enough. What the heck is a &#39;customer relationship management system&#39;, really? It sure ain&#39;t a system which manages relationships with customers, not really!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/810/1*NzgAJxkcpLdJVdq2R0v_SQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>M&#39;colleague Arthur Battram talks about getting to <em>primitives</em>, to irreducible concepts and ideas behind our lazy, sloppy language used for marketing and spin and bigging things up which don&#39;t deserve the inflation.</p><p>If you&#39;d like a hint of Arthur Battram&#39;s thinking on &#39;primitives&#39;, see his site <a href="http://plexity.wordpress.com/">http://plexity.wordpress.com</a></p><p>For example<br><a href="https://plexity.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/is-it-leadership-or-management-neither/">https://plexity.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/is-it-leadership-or-management-neither/</a><br><a href="https://plexity.wordpress.com/2021/06/25/message-found-in-a-bottle-of-snake-oil-in-the-sargasso-sea/">https://plexity.wordpress.com/2021/06/25/message-found-in-a-bottle-of-snake-oil-in-the-sargasso-sea/</a><br>And<br><a href="https://medium.com/@plexity/i-like-this-a-lot-aidan-thanks-c4cfb158a4c8">https://medium.com/@plexity/i-like-this-a-lot-aidan-thanks-c4cfb158a4c8</a></p><p>(where Aidan Ward suggested that the Batesonian primitive is ‘the difference that makes a difference)</p><p>I don&#39;t believe, like some, that we can have fixed, definitive meaning - all the language we have is a map of a map, a way to convey something in a context, with corrections, adjustments, and</p><p>But Capitalisation and Acronymisation take us away from the primitives, away from the real origins of the use of the world, and deeper into a realm of shadowplay and 🐮💩</p><p><strong><em>I&#39;d love to hear your examples of this - and also your little foibles in the spirit of good communications!</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*76LgF_EbJ39fZl71tOY9qg.jpeg" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bd1c81380d93" width="1" height="1" alt="">
