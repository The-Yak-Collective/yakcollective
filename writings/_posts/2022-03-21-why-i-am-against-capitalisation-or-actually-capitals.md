Have you ever been in a management meeting where everyone used the jargon, but nobody had a clue what they meant?

**The Power of Names, part three:**

And for the power of names parts one and two:

Folks in RedQuadrant know that I'm a demon for seeking out and removing what our style guide calls Unnecessary Capitalisation, A Prime Cause of The Reader Stumbling.

So, 'council' is lower case, as is borough, business process re-engineering is lower case (even in headings), business case and senior responsible officer are all lower case.

I did one tie myself up in knots and write 'London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham', but never mind.

We even write titles in ordinary sentence case - like finance director (the person who is the director of finance), unless we're emphasising the title like in 'David Hunter, Managing Director of‚Ä¶.' - because, if a job title has a meaning let's try to refer to the meaning!

And we spell out acronyms wherever possible: 'customer relationship management system', not 'CRM'. customerrelations are usually anything but.

I have plenty of other exciting stylistic foibles ('we' and 'you' not 'RedQuadrant' and 'the Council', never use '&', using the 'Oxford comma,' and so on).

But the point of this post isn't writing - it's meaning and understanding.

As soon as we Capitalise a thing - or, worse, use acronyms - we are working with the label, the name, not making an attempt to connect to the actual meaning of what we're talking about.

It's a silly thing, in some ways.

But I think it is important.

Communication is hard enough anyway, and the further we move to substitute labels for things - however convenient that actually is - the further we get from real meaning.

Of course, this doesn't go far enough. What the heck is a 'customer relationship management system', really? It sure ain't a system which manages relationships with customers, not really!

M'colleague Arthur Battram talks about getting to _primitives_, to irreducible concepts and ideas behind our lazy, sloppy language used for marketing and spin and bigging things up which don't deserve the inflation.

If you'd like a hint of Arthur Battram's thinking on 'primitives', see his site [http://plexity.wordpress.com](http://plexity.wordpress.com/)

For example  
[https://plexity.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/is-it-leadership-or-management-neither/](https://plexity.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/is-it-leadership-or-management-neither/)

(where Aidan Ward suggested that the Batesonian primitive is ‚Äòthe difference that makes a difference)

I don't believe, like some, that we can have fixed, definitive meaning - all the language we have is a map of a map, a way to convey something in a context, with corrections, adjustments, and

But Capitalisation and Acronymisation take us away from the primitives, away from the real origins of the use of the world, and deeper into a realm of shadowplay and üêÆüí©

**_I'd love to hear your examples of this - and also your little foibles in the spirit of good communications!_**
