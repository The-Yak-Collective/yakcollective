<p>Everyone from the United Nations to the OECD to old bastions of management thinking like Harvard Business review recognises that systems hinking and handling complexity are <strong>the</strong> key skills for the future.</p><p>Can these skills — which are so core to innovation — be formalised? Professionalised?</p><p>Can they support formal careers? Should they?</p><p>At <a href="https://systemspractice.org/">SCiO — Systems and Complexity in Organisation</a>, we began a journey many years ago with the creation of professional standards.</p><p>The latest culmination of this is… amazing!</p><p>We’re supplying world-class systems practitioner-tutors and supporting curriculum and approach for <a href="https://mailchi.mp/cherithsimmons/scio-systems-thinking-apprenticeship">Cherith Simmons Learning and Development</a> who provide the Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/541/1*kqD57YlgXZOXRblfh0fIUA.png" /></figure><p>For those in England and Wales, this opens up the potential of this two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person, fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and a learning management system that actually supports learning.</p><p>There are many risks and issues with professionalising a field, of which we are well aware.</p><p>This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills, where you’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning into practice right away — and evaluated on how you do so, and how you build in continual learning.</p><p>I think it’s a real breakthrough — and just the start of a new phase of creating more and more serious systems practitioners, more and more recognition — and more impact on real human challenges.</p><h3><strong>What could you do with a recognised system thinking practitioner qualification, and support from world-class experts to take your work to the next level?</strong></h3><h3><strong>What would be your first project?</strong></h3><p>To explore, see <a href="https://mailchi.mp/cherithsimmons/scio-systems-thinking-apprenticeship">https://mailchi.mp/cherithsimmons/scio-systems-thinking-apprenticeship</a></p><p>Other apprenticeship providers are available — this is only part of the start of much wider professional capability development.</p><p>And if you aren’t eligible for post-graduate adult apprenticeships in UK and Wales, don’t worry! Both Cherith Simmons and SCiO direct will be offering versions of the core training from the apprenticeship much more widely — you can also seek professional accreditation from SCiO for your portfolio of systems practice work: <a href="https://systemspractice.org/page/scio-competency-framework-professional-qualification">https://systemspractice.org/page/scio-competency-framework-professional-qualification</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/508/1*JQ6FlcEsWLHfxJJi8zfpAg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/492/1*HOYXJbkdO6Lir4fAzAoxGg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/497/1*DQ0nXTOyj-iKkSe1583Y0A.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*plv5P2OOOORE6U6J2wwiuA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*ZbVJjfxy_wsaKL4J8AA78g.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9c3e430b3352" width="1" height="1" alt="">
