Everyone from the United Nations to the OECD to old bastions of management thinking like Harvard Business review recognises that systems hinking and handling complexity are **the** key skills for the future.

Can these skills — which are so core to innovation — be formalised? Professionalised?

Can they support formal careers? Should they?

At [SCiO — Systems and Complexity in Organisation](https://systemspractice.org/), we began a journey many years ago with the creation of professional standards.

The latest culmination of this is… amazing!

We’re supplying world-class systems practitioner-tutors and supporting curriculum and approach for [Cherith Simmons Learning and Development](https://mailchi.mp/cherithsimmons/scio-systems-thinking-apprenticeship) who provide the Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship.

For those in England and Wales, this opens up the potential of this two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person, fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and a learning management system that actually supports learning.

There are many risks and issues with professionalising a field, of which we are well aware.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills, where you’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning into practice right away — and evaluated on how you do so, and how you build in continual learning.

I think it’s a real breakthrough — and just the start of a new phase of creating more and more serious systems practitioners, more and more recognition — and more impact on real human challenges.

### **What could you do with a recognised system thinking practitioner qualification, and support from world-class experts to take your work to the next level?**

### **What would be your first project?**

Other apprenticeship providers are available — this is only part of the start of much wider professional capability development.

And if you aren’t eligible for post-graduate adult apprenticeships in UK and Wales, don’t worry! Both Cherith Simmons and SCiO direct will be offering versions of the core training from the apprenticeship much more widely — you can also seek professional accreditation from SCiO for your portfolio of systems practice work: [https://systemspractice.org/page/scio-competency-framework-professional-qualification](https://systemspractice.org/page/scio-competency-framework-professional-qualification)
