<h2 id="comptia-security-exam-cram">CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram</h2>
<p>Today I’ll be covering Chapter 14 of the Security+ Exam Cram, “Embedded and Specialized Systems”. I should really have read this before <a href="https://cardboard-iguana.com/log/2022-03-27-itprotv-comptia-security-plus.html">March 27th</a>.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-systems">Embedded Systems</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best protections for maintaining embedded device security include requiring software and hardware vendors to provide evidence that the software has no security weaknesses…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bwah ha ha ha ha ha!</p>
<h3 id="soc-and-rtos">SoC and RTOS</h3>
<p>Interesting term here: “Intellectual Property (IP) block”, a SoC “module” that is acquired from a third-party vendor. Kind of like a software library, but for circuits. The implication (which Exam Cram doesn’t state but seems to imply) is that IP blocks have defined interfaces but otherwise operate as “black boxes” on a SoC. This reminds me a bit of how cellular modems often have their own processors and run their own operating systems (perhaps because these are “IP blocks”?).</p>
<p>FPGA = Field Programmable Gate Array</p>
<p>If I gather correctly, the difference between a CPU and an FPGA is that a CPU has a fixed architecture that can run multiple applications, while an FPGA has a programmable architecture that only runs <em>one</em> application (at a time). So, they’re <em>almost</em> mirror images of each other. CPUs are going to be more flexible, but FPGAs <em>can</em> be made faster for a given application (because the architecture can be programmed in a fashion that’s optimized for that application).</p>

<h3 id="scada-and-ics">SCADA and ICS</h3>
<p>SCADA = Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition</p>
<p>SCADA is part of the broad category of ICS (Industrial Control Systems); part of its job is to provide a human interface to industrial processes, but it can also just be concerned with internal data collection or automation. SCADA is not so much a “standard” in the IT-sense of the word as a “standardized way of handling and displaying information and connections between industrial systems”, which may be highly eccentric and proprietary under the hood.</p>
<p>ICS systems are generally touchy, and as such standard “hands-on” security practices often don’t work well. <em>Physical</em> external and internal segmentation and one-way data flows are the primary security mechanisms used for ICS.</p>

<h3 id="smart-devices-and-iot">Smart Devices and IoT</h3>
<p>The Exam Cram apparently considers the Roomba the first widely-used home automation system!</p>
<p>How to find out if home automation is vulnerable to public attack? The Exam Cram recommends Shodan!</p>
<p>Another mention of “Zigbee” as a home automation tool. Apparently this actually is an IEEE standard for the creation of “wireless personal area networks” (WPANs) — think Bluetooth, but shorter range, lower data rate, and lower power.</p>

<h3 id="multifunction-devices">Multifunction Devices</h3>
<p>“Multifunction devices” are somewhat confusingly abbreviated as MFDs. Basically, this is a fancy name for printer/copier/scanner/fax units.</p>
<h3 id="special-purpose-devices">Special-Purpose Devices</h3>
<p>The Exam Cram defines “special-purpose devices” as single-processor, industry-specific devices that are designed for only a single function (which often means running a single, embedded, program).</p>
<h3 id="medical-devices">Medical Devices</h3>
<p>While the potential for medical device hacks generate a lot of (very real and justified!) concern, the statistics provided by the Exam Cram indicate that &lt; 0.5% of medical devices are actually publicly discoverable on the internet.</p>
<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>
<p>Apparently, internal device communications within automobiles is all plaintext, which is a problem when systems connected to the vehicle CAN (controller area network) are then connected to the internet as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="resource-constraints">Resource Constraints</h3>
<p>This section reminds me of a trilemma I coined during a discussion with other members of the Yak Collective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NECOPINUS’ TRILEMMA: For any computational system, there is a trade-off between the integrity of the system’s computations, the speed at which these computations can be made, and the energy used by the system while making those computations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I later posted that to Twitter, and came up with a pithier corollary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secure, fast, inexpensive: Pick two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it goes.</p>
