<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<p>Type I hypervisors (bare metal) are most common in business applications. And Qubes. Cloud systems are obviously all based around Type I hypervisors.</p>
<p>Type II hypervisors are just specialized applications. VirtualBox, etc. Fine for individuals, but not as efficient… And certainly not scalable!</p>
<p>Virtual (guest) networking is accomplished using a switch virtualized within the hypervisor. Virtual networking can be fully isolated, VM-to-host, or VM-to-LAN (which obviously also includes the host).</p>
<p>Major cloud container providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker Hub</li>
<li>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute</li>
<li>Canonical LXD</li>
<li>Amazon Elastic Container Service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-concepts">Cloud Concepts</h2>
<p>Cloud Computing: Delivery of computing services over the internet.</p>
<p>Cloud Service Provider: Organization providing cloud computing services.</p>
<p>Tenant: A single customer or multiple customers within a cloud provider’s network.</p>
<p>Elasticity: The ability of (additional) resources to be assigned (to a tenant) without service interruption.</p>
<p>Scaling Out: Adding more instances to service.</p>
<p>Scaling Up: Adding more resources (compute, RAM, etc.) to an instance.</p>
<p>(Confusingly, the opposite of both “scaling out” and “scaling up” tends to be called “scaling down”.)</p>
<h2 id="cloud-services">Cloud Services</h2>
<p>“Traditional” cloud services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS): Applications provided on cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS): Runtime environment provided on cloud infrastructure. (Glitch, but also Quickbase.)</li>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Organization providing cloud computing services.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Anything as a Service” (XaaS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers as a Service (CaaS)</li>
<li>Code as a Service (CaaS)</li>
<li>Storage as a Service (STaaS)</li>
<li>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</li>
<li>Security as a Service (SECaaS)</li>
<li>Database as a Service (DBaaS)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-models">Cloud Models</h2>
<ul>
<li>Public: Azure, AWS, GCP, et al.</li>
<li>Private: Cloud infrastructure that is used, managed, operated, and owned by a single organization. Basically on-prem++. Some times used to refer to (physical + logical) portions of public cloud infrastructure that are dedicated to a single customer.</li>
<li>Community: Like a private cloud, but shared by multiple organizations within a single industry (i.e., more specialized / smaller customer base than a public cloud).</li>
<li>Hybrid: Infrastructure that spans multiple cloud models (and/or on-prem).</li>
</ul>
<p>“Transit gateways” provide inter-cloud and cloud-to-on-prem connections in hybrid situations.</p>
<h2 id="computing-types">Computing Types</h2>
<p>Cloud vs. Edge vs. “Fog” computing.</p>
<p>(“Fog” computing is really about enabling edge-like computing for ultra-low power IoT devices. Such devices generally require some more powerful local system — the “IoT gateway” — to handle processing and data storage tasks. This system, in turn, may periodically communicate with either cloud-based systems or more distributed systems known as “fog nodes”.)</p>
<p>It’s really all about latency.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of “human” cloud services — managed service providers (MSPs).</p>
<p>Security MSPs go by their own moniker — MSSPs (“managed <em>security</em> service providers”).</p>
<p>On a completely random note, ITPro.TV’s also going to cover software-defined networking (SDN). ITPro.TV seems to be defining software-defined networking as API-driven and abstracted network management. Three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Layer: Applications using, or providing management panes on to, the network.</li>
<li>Control Layer: The “SDN controller”, which orchestrates the underlying infrastructure.</li>
<li>Infrastructure Layer: This is what we normally work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Application/Controller communication is called the “northbound API”; this is less standardized but generally involves REST APIs.</p>
<p>Controller/Infrastructure communication is called the “southbound API”, and is generally implemented using OpenFlow.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-security-controls">Cloud Security Controls</h2>
<p>Networking controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Subnets: Think of these as DMZs. They are connected to the broader internet by way of “secure web gateways”, which provide firewall/proxy-like DNS filtering and IDS/IDP services (though low-level traffic filtering is handled by security groups).</li>
<li>Private Subnets: Virtual networks for which public connections are not allowed. The VPC endpoint provides firewall/proxy-like controls between private and public subnets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Groups: Virtual firewalls, but only of the stateful sort. Sometimes protocol/application aware. Note that most next-gen firewall capabilities (IDS/IDP, etc.) really live within “secure web gateways” and “VPC endpoints”.</li>
</ul>
