We have a son!

Three weeks ago, Avital gave birth to our son Curio Rav Lubin. We’re doing amazing and loving our time together.

## About his name

His first name is Curio, inspired by our core value of “Persistent Curiosity.” His middle name, Rav, is Hebrew for abundance and guide/teacher and it’s also in honor of my uncle Robby.

## Birth story

Curio was born a month before his due date. Avital went in for a routine checkup when they diagnosed her with pre-eclampsia and they decided to induce labor that night. She gave birth the next day and both she and Curio are healthy and happy.

Curio ended up spending a week in the NICU until he gained enough weight, which he did quickly. He’s home now and it’s wonderful having him here!
