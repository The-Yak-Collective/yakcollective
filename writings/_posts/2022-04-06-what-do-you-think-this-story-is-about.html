There’s an uneasy, pathetic balance, based on the village paying regular tributes to the dragon. But over time the dragon’s demand for gold, riches, and maidens grows ever more unbearable.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-bUo4Zi8QGiuKtpX" /><figcaption>While I was writing this — having never been able to track down what I think is an old socialist fairy tale (I think this story was told to me originally at a Socialist Organiser summer camp), I came across this piece <a href="https://archive.ph/kpO9g">https://archive.ph/kpO9g#selection-563.0-705.246</a> ‘to understand modern autocrats, read Soviet children’s literature’</figcaption></figure><p>So the elders go to the bravest, greatest young warrior, and, with tears in their eyes, beg him to face the dragon in mortal combat despite near-certain death.</p><p>The champion has trained all his life for this, and after a scarcely noticeable moment’s hesitation, he agrees.</p><p>The village gather, recite epic poems in his honour, hymn and feast him, and equip him for the fatal mission.</p><p>So, come dawn, well refreshed and armoured, the hero treks to the dragon’s lair on the mountain overlooking the village.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*NQT70iYKhLzXFBP8" /><figcaption>Margaret the Virgin<br>“…various miraculous incidents occurred. One of these involved being swallowed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan">Satan</a> in the shape of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon">dragon</a>, from which she escaped alive when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross">cross</a> she carried irritated the dragon’s innards. Eventually, she was decapitated”<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_the_Virgin">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_the_Virgin</a></figcaption></figure><p>Striking his sword against his shield, he challenges the great beast to a fight to the death.</p><p>But the dragon is surprisingly urbane.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TWJ3iuKl8hTCcbOo" /></figure><p>‘Dear chap!’ he says. ‘But of course I shall oblige you. Nevertheless, it is a long trek up here, you must be gasping. May I at least offer you a cup of tea before we battle?’</p><p>Taking the hero under his wing, he guides him into the cave, the absolute height of civilisation and (glittery) good taste. While he pours fine tea (surprisingly delicately) into china cups, and they refresh themselves with a couple of butter biscuits, the dragon talks.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_AgVGxSBNKg18XGL" /></figure><p>Never has the hero heard such wisdom and sense in his life.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SCfVK1k1bV3PGfCw" /></figure><p>Suddenly, it becomes crystal clear to him why the dragon must terrorise the village, why the levy of gold and virgins is so essential. Why it’s actually an honour for the village to be under dragon guardianship — and THIS dragon in particular! And why the dragon suffers so terribly from his duties, and in particular from the utterly regrettable need to slay champions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/597/0*4JudofpAl7WS7fTT" /><figcaption>I found this from David Reay on Twitter (​<br><a href="https://twitter.com/DReay/status/1242193740548063232?s=20&amp;t=_8z-mvM02qAAJ-6wuuu7SA">https://twitter.com/DReay/status/1242193740548063232?s=20&amp;t=_8z-mvM02qAAJ-6wuuu7SA</a> )​​<br>“In Canada we have the story of Mouseland where the mice always elect cats to protect them. The cats then pass laws based on what cats need.​ ​<br>Mouseland is an NDP standard. Popularized by Tommy Douglas and is available on a variety of websites.

He has a new and more glorious quest, after all — to educate the people of the village!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0kNwG9hTBtGR4GJN" /></figure><p>At the outskirts, the hullaballoo begins. Curious and excited villagers begin to encircle him as he marches. Never has a hero returned alive before! What can this mean?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-5eCJbgRcz71yT1n" /></figure><p>But he holds his counsel until he reaches the village square, and there in front of the assembled elders and all of his community (including several rather hopeful maidens), he… forgets.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/0*M6QyD2vgz4ZZfOT-" /></figure><p>Darn it! It was so clear! All perfectly laid out and ordered and explained. But…</p><p>He mumbles. He pauses. He tries to think. But it is no use, the dragon’s tale has gone.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/828/0*aNTU855CbYH4jCmc" /></figure><p><strong><em>What does this story say to you?</em></strong></p><p>Comments on LinkedIn please!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2909951bfc94" width="1" height="1" alt="">
