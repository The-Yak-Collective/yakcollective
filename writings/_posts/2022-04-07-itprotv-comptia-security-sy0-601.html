<h1 id="comptia-security-exam-cram">CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram</h1>
<p>Today I’ll be reading Chapter 13 of the Security+ Exam Cram, “Cybersecurity Resilience”.</p>
<h2 id="redundancy">Redundancy</h2>
<p>Power redundancy options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual power supplies (within a PC/server)</li>
<li>UPSes</li>
<li>Generators</li>
<li>Managed power distribution units (PDUs) - basically fancy power strips</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="load-balancers">Load Balancers</h2>
<p>Common algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-robin</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Least (open) connections</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these can also be weighted by various factors.</p>
<p>“Session affinity”, which ties a particular session to a particular server in the cluster, is important here for performance and complexity reasons.</p>
<h2 id="nic-teaming">NIC Teaming</h2>
<p>The idea here is to “bond” multiple NICs into a single logical unit. This logical unit can then be used for redundancy and load balancing in the same way that a server cluster might be.</p>
<h2 id="raid">RAID</h2>
<ul>
<li>RAID 0: Drives are logically joined in serial to create a single large drive.</li>
<li>RAID 1: Drives are logically joined in parallel to create a single <em>redundant</em> drive.</li>
<li>RAID 5: At least three drives are joined in parallel, with space allocated so that the data on any one drive can be reconstructed should it fail. This creates a logical drive larger than any single drive (though not as large as all three drives), but with similar redundancy characteristics as RAID 1.</li>
<li>RAID 1+0 / 0+1: Both of these approaches require at least four disks, and are sometimes collectively knowns as “RAID 10”. This is either a RAID 1 array where the component disks are actually RAID 0 arrays (0+1), or a RAID 0 array where the component disks are RAID 1 arrays (1+0)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full</li>
<li>Differential (difference since the last full backup)</li>
<li>Incremental (difference since the last full or incremental backup)</li>
</ul>
<p>At least some operating systems seem to have the concept of an “archive” bit which added whenever a file is changed. Full backups ignore but reset this bit. Differential backups use the archival bit but don’t reset it. Incremental backups use <em>and</em> reset the archival bit.</p>
<h2 id="defense-in-depth">Defense in Depth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Defense in depth stems from the philosophy that complete security against threats can never be achieved; the components that comprise a layered security strategy only impede threat progress until either the attacker gives up or the organization can respond to the threat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hardware-redundancy">Hardware Redundancy</h2>
<p>“High availability” is considered 99.999% uptime.</p>
<p>RAID 0 is capped at 32 disks.</p>
<p>Note that all all RAID systems - even RAID 0 - write information sequentially across drives in order to maximize performance (block 1 to drive 1, block 2 to drive 2, and so on). In RAID 5 there is also a parity block that isn’t used for reads but is used to reconstruct data in the event of a disk failure. RAID 5 writes the parity block in a rotating fashion between drives (so that no two parity blocks follow each other and parity blocks are evenly distributed between drives).</p>
<h2 id="site-redundancy">Site Redundancy</h2>
<p>(General) redundancy types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot (everything is ready to go, just on standby)</li>
<li>Warm (key systems are ready to go, but some reconfiguration required)</li>
<li>Cold (equipment <em>might</em> exist, but no configuration/readiness)</li>
</ul>
