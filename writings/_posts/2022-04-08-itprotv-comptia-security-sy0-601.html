<p>Ways of restoring OS failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning to the “last known good” state (revert boot configuration, but no OS data/applications).</li>
<li>Reverting to a previous “known state” (revert all configurations and operating system files).</li>
<li>Reverting to a snapshot (most common in VMs; reverts all data on disk).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Windows writes the “last known good” state during the first login after a boot. “Known state” in Windows refers to “system restore points”.</p>
<p>Interesting idea here: Using PXE boot to pull recovery/live images over the network for forensics/troubleshooting.</p>
