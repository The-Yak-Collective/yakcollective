<h3>When have you seen someone break a well-established pattern? What were the consequences of that action?</h3><p>In businessm and in life, the easiest thing is to go along with the established patterns. They’re there for a reason, they’ve been set up over decades and generations, they give us the way things are done.</p><p>To change them is to go against tradition, to take on risk, to break into the unknown.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/331/0*6zGAWJ_HJ5bS2bkO" /></figure><p>Yet often the moments of truth, innovation, creation of breakthrough are pattern breaks. Systems change always is.</p><p>At a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>The Public Service Transformation Academy</strong></a> awayday, we ended up reflecting on pattern-breaking quite a lot.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><strong>Royston John</strong></a> challenged us to an exercise where we thought about ‘radicals’, and what we would do if we co-facilitated with them.</p><p>Some examples I loved:</p><p>&gt; Abolitionists fighting slavery with powerful symbolism and arguments that showed the true force and implications of espoused religious and moral beliefs.</p><p>&gt; Extinction Rebellion, using the power of fear and passion to make the argument that there’s really no alternative choice to radical climate action, with the belief that if 3.5% of people are willing to put themselves on the line, the system *must* change</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*v0S9mKV3TCwGQk8q" /></figure><p>&gt; The psychological shift of the Otpor movement using the phrase ‘gotov je’ (‘it’s over / he’s over’) to hasten the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic — suddenly, people were forced to think ‘maybe he’s not unassailable — maybe he won’t be in power forever’</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/219/0*yRzmWs7al1oj61zn" /></figure><p>&gt; The example in Vaclav Havel’s The Power of the Powerless — the impact of a greengrocer simply removing the sign from his window that read ‘workers of the world unite’ — refusing to signal compliance with the regime.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/794/0*xIjTOkQUdA4byKNe" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*sQQL8gx-wQMA2NDl" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tmF08vajfqBGillH" /></figure><p>&gt; The story — I think from Peter Block’s Flawless Consulting or something of that period — of the consultant, presenting their findings and analysis. The leader gets up from the table and goes to pour a coffee at the back of the room. The consultant says ‘oh, okay, yes, grab a coffee, I’ll wait’. The leader gestures that he *is* paying attention — ‘you carry on’. ‘No, it’s OK, I want your full attention. I’ll wait until you’re ready’.</p><p>&gt; The quiet sexist or racist comment or ‘joke’, and the response ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that — could you say it again, please?’</p><p>Each of these creates an explicit moment of choice in an implicit flow that sweeps everyone along, for better or worse, these pattern-breaking acts or speech acts offer something. A rock to hold on to, to get out of the river, perhaps. Or perhaps just the tiniest twig end of a tree branch, that won’t hold against the current.</p><p>Part of the choice, the moment of tension, the crisis they create, is that they could have implications for the speaker.</p><p><strong><em>When have you seen pattern-breaking used to good effect?</em></strong></p><p>Peter Block, following Werner Erhard, says about this that ‘all transformation is linguistic — are we speaking into a different world?’ — and I think it’s clear that this use of ‘linguistic’ includes symbolism.</p><p>I might follow this up with further thoughts on embedded ‘we’ve always done things this way’ patterns, with more on ‘there are implications to every action’, and/or with dealing with pressure to act in bad faith, if you’re interested?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=61248190e33c" width="1" height="1" alt="">
