<p>Today’s reading is Chapter 30 from the Security+ Exam Cram, “Digital Forensics”.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-volatility">Order of Volatility</h2>
<p>The idea here is to gather evidence from the most volatile storage (generally RAM) to the least volatile (generally backups or off-system logs). Prioritize imaging/copying/investigating storage so that you run the minimum risk of loosing information!</p>
<p>First-line information:</p>
<ul>
<li>System date, time, etc.</li>
<li>Currently established network connections</li>
<li>Currently open ports and associated applications/services</li>
<li>Other running applications/services</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical order of volatility:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU registers/caches</li>
<li>Peripheral &amp; expansion card memory (particularly networking cards)</li>
<li>Kernel memory</li>
<li>Non-kernel memory</li>
<li>tmpfs &amp; friends</li>
<li>Onboard storage</li>
<li>Removable rewritable storage</li>
<li>Removable write-once storage</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m guessing that external logs probably sit between removable rewritable storage and removable write-once storage.</p>
<h2 id="chain-of-custody">Chain of Custody</h2>
<p>Basically, log all the things. Time, date, action, people involved. Include thought processes and inferences. Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admissible (following legal or organizational standards)</li>
<li>Authentic (shown to be related to the investigation at hand)</li>
<li>Complete (covers all angles - for example, <em>all</em> users logged into a system, not just accounts of interest)</li>
<li>Reliable (shown to be unmodified)</li>
<li>Believable (basically, written in a way that non-technical audiences can follow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Investigative steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential evidence</li>
<li>Determine preservation techniques</li>
<li>Extract, process, log, interpret, etc.</li>
<li>Clean up for presentation (corporate or legal)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-acquisition">Data Acquisition</h2>
<ul>
<li>System Images (be careful to ensure that these cannot be inadvertently written to during analysis!)</li>
<li>Network Traffic &amp; Logs (traffic is generally only captured in the event that the incident is ongoing when the investigation begins)</li>
<li>Video &amp; Photographs (the point here is to try to demonstrate that evidence was not planted)</li>
<li>System Time &amp; Time Zone (important to record early because computers use all sorts of different time zones)</li>
<li>Hashes (to verify that forensic images are the same as the original data, and that data has not been changed during analysis)</li>
<li>Screenshots</li>
<li>Witnesses</li>
</ul>
