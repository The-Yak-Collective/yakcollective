<p>What is one thing you’d like to offer to adult social care commissioners to help them decide their approach?</p><p>How can you make better decisions in <strong>#complexity</strong>?</p><p>How do we ensure a better <strong>#future</strong> for citizens, communities — and ourselves?</p><p>How can we encourage <strong>#innovation</strong> in an over-pressurised and partly broken system?</p><p>Adult social care <strong>#commissioning</strong> is a fantastic space to explore these issues, as we’ve been doing for the last few weeks on an interesting project, and for years before that!</p><p>Commissioning in adult social care means shaping a complex system to get better outcomes for people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities or physical or mental health issues.</p><p>It can be as narrow (but challenging) as ‘procuring organisations to provide homecare’, and as wide and messy as ‘shaping a community where everyone can thrive’.</p><p>As a commissioner, you have varying levels of power, authority, capability, respect, and understanding in your organisation.</p><p>…you have to constantly respond to crises (most of them caused by ‘austerity’): a provider of care collapsing; problems recruiting and retaining workforce because they’re paid less than Amazon; 30% of carers off sick with COVID; an urgent need for particular specialist mental health services (say).</p><p>…and you have to work in a place, with all its complexities:</p><p>- do the chief executives of the council and the hospital trust get along, or can they not be trusted to be in the same room together?</p><p>- do our providers trust us, or are they still hurting because we clumsily tried to reduce their fees three years ago?</p><p>- do the community organisations agree with our ideas about ‘coproduction’, or do they see it as foisting the costs of care on to them?</p><p>What we’re doing is trying to produce a tool to help people doing this messy, complex job to assess their context, and:</p><p>1- put together a commissioning development plan to get more ability to influence the system of health and care in their place (or, even, the system of wellbeing)</p><p>2- decide which of twelve ‘commissioning approaches’ fits their place and their needs best</p><p>We’ve been running this as a <strong>#workoutloud</strong> process — so if you fancy diving in and contributing, you’re welcome! There’s an open Mural board and an open meeting on Wednesday 20 April at 2:30pm (links below).</p><p>Or you can give us a quick comment here:</p><p><strong><em>What is one thing you’d like to offer to adult social care commissioners to help them decide their approach?</em></strong></p><p>As well as the slides (scroll to the bottom), the draft working documents are on a Mural board for comment, at <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/redquadrant9812/m/redquadrant9812/1644015309200/e20e0564cb7277f742c6f3923f2cc0d6e90ca20e?sender=benjamintaylor2777">https://app.mural.co/t/redquadrant9812/m/redquadrant9812/1644015309200/e20e0564cb7277f742c6f3923f2cc0d6e90ca20e?sender=benjamintaylor2777</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FLSZP3HI_WJgaOSh" /></figure><p>And there’s a final meeting of our open group for anybody who wants to comment on Wednesday 20th 2:30–3:45pm which you are welcome to attend — registration needed at <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYld-CtrDMtH9RG2dYFmpqKoLqPbBZz82eU">https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYld-CtrDMtH9RG2dYFmpqKoLqPbBZz82eU</a></p><p><em>About this work:</em></p><p>The Public Service Transformation Academy has been commissioned by the LGA (the Care and Health Improvement Programme, jointly run with DHSC and ADASS) to produce a tool for adult social care commissioners to go through strategic options appraisal — i.e. to assess their place and decide the best approach to commissioning.</p><p><em>The slides in PDF:</em></p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2Fkey%2FDG1y3tsyATQpSB&amp;display_name=SlideShare&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2Fkey%2FDG1y3tsyATQpSB%3FhostedIn%3Dslideshare%26page%3Dupload&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2F2022-04-12projectupdate-thepstawithredquadrant-lgastrategiccommissioningoptionsappraisalv2-220413100248-thumbnail.jpg%3Fcb%3D1649844195&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=slideshare" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/aacc9ef519f4fec86f8b6a110483be89/href">https://medium.com/media/aacc9ef519f4fec86f8b6a110483be89/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dde7e4ed7da3" width="1" height="1" alt="">
