<p><em>This essay is part of the <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/on-lore">On Lore</a> series.</em></p><p>One of my favorite bits of the <em>Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy </em>is an exchange between Ford Prefect and the Vogon guard who has been tasked with throwing Ford and Arthur Dent out of the airlock. Ford is trying desperately to stall for time:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ford: </strong>I mean does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping around, shouting, throwing people out of spaceships?<br><br><strong>Vogon Guard: </strong>The hours are good.<br><br><strong>Ford: </strong>They&#8217;d have to be.<br><br><strong>Vogon Guard: </strong>But now that you&#8217;ve come to mention it, I suppose much of the actual minutes are pretty lousy. Er, er. Except some of the shouting I quite like. Resistance is use-<br><br><strong>Ford: </strong>Yeah, sure, yes... You&#8217;re good at that I can tell&#8230; but if it&#8217;s mostly lousy, then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The machismo?</p></blockquote><p>Last week, we looked at some of the larger, macro-level functions of lore from the point of view of the lorecrafters who try to shape raw lore to their own ends, and how it shapes dark, gray, or light epistemologies. This is like the central-banking level of lorecrafting.</p><p>This week, I want to zoom in on the micro-level functions of lore at the level of day-to-day habits and ingrained behaviors, where the center of gravity of lore is actually situated. This is the household-budgeting level of the lorecrafting.</p><p>My hypothesis is that the function of lore at this level is to elevate the stream of lousy minutes to at least indifferent, and perhaps introduce a few great minutes into the stream, to make the rest of them worthwhile. </p><p>The better the lore, the larger the fraction of great minutes relative to indifferent or lousy ones. </p><p>In the limit, a lore-utopia is one where all the minutes are great and you don&#8217;t have to care about the hours at all. You can forget about big goals, epic journeys, and consequentialist projects. You can simply live in the moment, because every minute is its own reward. You&#8217;re not grinding away to make that <em>one</em> moment five years out &#8212; perhaps the Mars landing moment &#8212; super-duper extra-special to make up for all the lousy ones. Life itself has arrived in the happily-ever-after post-narrative (or post-historical phase).</p><p>Of course, there are no real lore-utopias. But we get a small taste from time to time.</p><p>Why, for instance, is there so much lore around coffee brewing? Why do coffee aficionados have vast stores of tips and ideas about equipment, roasts, and brewing techniques to swap with each other?</p><p>It&#8217;s because making and drinking your coffee in the morning or afternoon creates one of the rare great minutes in the stream of lousy and indifferent ones that make up a typical day for most people. Coffee rituals are a source of &#8220;great minute&#8221; lore.</p><p>But while &#8220;great minutes&#8221; lore is the most obviously attractive kind, the bulk of lore is devoted to making the lousy minutes somewhat less lousy, rather than crafting the great minutes.</p><p>How does lore do that? I think Marx was on the right track with his idea that religion is the opium of the masses. But you need a more fine-grained approach. Lore is something like a psyche-management memetic nootropic stack.</p><p>Let&#8217;s explore the stack and how it works.</p>
