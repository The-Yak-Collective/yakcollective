<h3>How do you deal with unreasonable demands at work — when there’s no way out?</h3><p>I had a conversation with a client yesterday that I think will stick with me.</p><p>He said (roughly) ‘in organisations I’ve worked in before, we used to go for those kinds of things like ‘top 100 organisations to work for’, and so we did ‘#culture audits’ where there was a lot of pressure to agree — ‘say this is a good place to work, and the results will be good for all of us’’.</p><p>It’s like asking people what their working life is like while there’s a big sign on the wall that says ‘our values: honesty, commitment, delivery’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*livEsoNwHV4bXN8d" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/shehabkhan/status/662295476755161088?lang=de">https://twitter.com/shehabkhan/status/662295476755161088?lang=de</a><br>From: <a href="http://i.doubt.it/2015/09/11/mediaeval-europe/">http://i.doubt.it/2015/09/11/mediaeval-europe/</a></figcaption></figure><p>It destroys #innovation, motivation, #careers — and people.</p><p>The messages that people receive — over and over again, from those with power and authority — are:<br>1) ‘tell the truth’<br>2) ‘we want to hear that everyone tells the truth around here’<br>3) ‘as an organisation, we’re deeply proud that our words can be trusted’</p><p>Can you see the trap?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DgEM-eQPANoknWAD" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/772/0*YxyoQna4Why70f8P" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/10/1/Modelling-the-Structure-of-Binds-and-Double-Binds/Page1.html">https://cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/10/1/Modelling-the-Structure-of-Binds-and-Double-Binds/Page1.html</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s try one more:<br>1) ‘we’d like to hear what it’s like to work here’<br>2) ‘if we all say it’s a great place to work, this will be a slightly better place to work’<br>3) ‘finding out what it’s like to work around here will deal with the complaints we keep getting once and for all’</p><p>We see it all the time in requirements for inspection, compliance, governance, procurement.</p><p>You get:</p><ul><li>Rules you must follow to play the game (which are completely inappropriate for actually doing the right thing).</li><li>Punishments if you follow the rules and therefore do the wrong thing.</li><li>And punishments if you break the rules in order to do the right thing.</li></ul><p>(hat tip Patrick Hoverstadt for recently formulating this in a similar way recently)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*UPWlcfWpDhMHjIIU" /></figure><p>It’s maddening!</p><p>In fact, in a famous paper from Bateson et al (1956), this pattern — the double bind — was held up as a cause of schizophrenia.</p><p>I know for sure it can trigger chronic stress and breakdowns.</p><p><em>Can you think of examples?</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ws7ZbvxjBysyckSo" /><figcaption>Artist: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KasiaBabisComics">https://www.facebook.com/KasiaBabisComics</a></figcaption></figure><p>I have experience <em>so much</em> of this in the systems I have to engage with (it is partly why I maintain such an independent position), and my core tactics are:</p><p>1 find the least soul-destroying bad-faith compromise</p><p>2 break the injunction to keep quiet about it — risk escalating the pain and being pushed out of the system by talking very loudly about it in public and with people who in theory might be able to influence<br>BUT without going ‘rebel’ and making <em>that</em> the centre of my engagement with the system</p><p>3 complain a lot with fellow sufferers<br>BUT without making <em>that</em> the centre of my identity, draining everyone around me</p><p>4 <em>try</em> not to replicate this in anything actually in my control</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LyQy3uaJNTJqcXAF" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956522122000057">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956522122000057</a></figcaption></figure><p><em>What examples have you seen?
