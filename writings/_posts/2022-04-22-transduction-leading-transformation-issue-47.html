SAVVI, led by Tameside Council and sponsored by GMCA, aims to use data to find vulnerable people. The project is developing a catalogue of datasets, their sources and the basis on which they can be used by organisations delivering public services to identify individuals or households with particular vulnerabilities, such as for the purpose of homelessness prevention. Having worked with local authority and publicly available secondary data for some time, often building specific analytical tools to spec, I saw the potential straight away of SAVVI to transform how organisations delivering public services use their and others’ data to improve the work they do and outcomes for the vulnerable people identified. Vulnerability often looks different from different parts of the system, and it can be difficult to fully identify vulnerability and people’s needs from within a single service so my hope is that SAVVI brings different perspectives across the system of public services together in the form of powerful datasets that can be used to identify, and then support, those whose needs are currently invisible.</p><h4><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/esmyj72c6skeoqc/2020-01-08%20RedQuadrant%20reading%20list%20-%20public%20service%20transformation%20and%20complexity.pdf?dl=0&amp;utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Dropbox — 2020–01–08 RedQuadrant reading list — public service transformation and complexity.pdf</a></h4><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/esmyj72c6skeoqc/2020-01-08%20RedQuadrant%20reading%20list%20-%20public%20service%20transformation%20and%20complexity.pdf?dl=0">www.dropbox.com</a> <br> Reading list — public service transformation and complexity</p><h3>public | service | transformation</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*Q-AtugCsuV7q6aIZ" /></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/MariaKordowicz/status/1516761669040541696?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>Dr Maria Kordowicz FRSA on Twitter</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MariaKordowicz/status/1516761669040541696"><strong>twitter.com</strong></a> <br> Pleasure to deliver a session on Evidence-Based Commissioning to County Council Commissioners today through @antlerboy @ServiceReform @RedQuadrant @TSIPtweets</p><h4><a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2022/04/18/wicked-problems-in-public-policy-head-2022/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Wicked Problems in Public Policy | Head (2022)</a></h4><p><a href="https://stream.syscoi.com/2022/04/18/wicked-problems-in-public-policy-head-2022/">stream.syscoi.com</a></p><p>Wicked Problems in Public PolicyUnderstanding and Responding to Complex ChallengesAuthors (view affiliations)Brian W.
