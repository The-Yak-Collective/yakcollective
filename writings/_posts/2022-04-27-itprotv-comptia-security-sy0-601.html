<h1 id="comptia-security-exam-cram">CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram</h1>
<p>Today I’ll be reading Chapter 33 of the Security+ Exam Cram, “Organizational Security Policies”.</p>
<h2 id="policy-framework">Policy Framework</h2>
<p>Parts of a framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy (management statements)</li>
<li>Standards (specific controls that implement the policy)</li>
<li>Guidelines (recommended methods of realizing the standards)</li>
<li>Procedures (specific, step-by-step instructions for implementing guidelines)</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy -&gt; procedure flow above transforms <em>descriptive</em> statements into <em>prescriptive</em> ones.</p>
<h2 id="human-resource-management-policies">Human Resource Management Policies</h2>
<p>Policies should be reviewed by <em>both</em> legal and HR.</p>
<h2 id="background-checks">Background Checks</h2>
<p>The Exam Cram lumps everything from reference checks to more traditional background checks and drug testing here.</p>
<h2 id="onboarding-and-offboarding">Onboarding and Offboarding</h2>
<p>The Exam Cram recommends that employees sign formal ethics statements.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-vacations">Mandatory Vacations</h2>
<p>The Exam Cram recommends mandatory vacations (to check for operational gaps) and regular rotation of duties (for cross-training purposes).</p>
<h2 id="separation-of-duties">Separation of Duties</h2>
<p>The Exam Cram emphasizes making sure that no one individual controls a process or transaction. Not sure how to reconcile this with the concept of a “single wringable neck” (perhaps by not allowing someone <em>responsible</em> for a process actually <em>perform</em> the process?).</p>
<h2 id="job-rotation">Job Rotation</h2>
<p>The Exam Cram also positions job rotation and mandatory vacations as a way of having admins check each other’s work.</p>
<h2 id="clean-desk-policies">Clean Desk Policies</h2>
<p>Basically, keeping work areas free of <em>any</em> information is a simple way to make sure that they do not contain unattended <em>sensitive</em> information.</p>
<h2 id="role-based-awareness-and-training">Role-Based Awareness and Training</h2>
<p>User types:</p>
<ul>
<li>General users (the unwashed masses)</li>
<li>Privileged users (access to restricted data)</li>
<li>System administrators (responsible for data integrity and/or entire systems)</li>
<li>Executives (privileged access to data but unprivileged access to systems)</li>
<li>Data owners (bottom-line responsible for a given data set)</li>
<li>Systems owners (bottom-line responsible for a given system)</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically System administrators work under data and system owners (who may be the same person, or may head up parallel teams).</p>
<p>Executives and data/system owners are the people who should be designing and pushing policies, standards, and procedures (I’d expect the latter to be delegated to system admins sometimes).</p>
<h2 id="acceptable-use-policy--rules-of-behavior">Acceptable Use Policy / Rules of Behavior</h2>
<p>Ah, codes of conduct.</p>
<p>Exam Cram suggests that all users get notifications about network/computer use being monitored on logon.</p>
<h2 id="disciplinary-and-adverse-actions">Disciplinary and Adverse Actions</h2>
<p>Exam Cram notes that all policy documents should include jurisdictional information in case they become subject to a legal dispute or part of a criminal action.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability-agreements">Interoperability Agreements</h2>
<p>Types of third-party IT/security agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Level Agreement (SLA; specifies a provided service and associated performance parameters)</li>
<li>Business Partner Agreement (BPA; covers profit sharing, responsibilities, etc.)</li>
<li>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU; outlines an agreement)</li>
<li>Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA; supports an MOU by detailing associated technical and security measures and requirements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Exam Cram notes that only an ISA actually spells out security requirements.</p>
<h1 id="itprotv-comptia-security-sy0-601-1">ITPro.TV: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601)</h1>
<h2 id="organizational-security-policies---personnel">Organizational Security Policies - Personnel</h2>
<p>Policies that help detect/prevent malicious behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job rotation</li>
<li>Mandatory vacations</li>
<li>Separation of duties</li>
<li>Least privilege</li>
<li>Acceptable use policies</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam Gordon makes an interesting point: Separation of duties implies that roles like “backup administrator” should actually be split into “backup administrator” <em>and</em> “restore administrator”. It does seem like perhaps these duties should be rotated, though?</p>
<p>Permission = The <em>ability</em> to do something</p>
<p>Right = The <em>authorization</em> to do something</p>
<p>Privilege = Permissions + Rights</p>
<p>Policies related to employee/vendor lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background checks</li>
<li>NDAs</li>
<li>Social media policies/analysis</li>
<li>Onboarding</li>
<li>Offboarding</li>
</ul>
<p>Policies related to security awareness and training:</p>
<ul>
<li>User training</li>
<li>Clean desk policies</li>
<li>Gamification</li>
<li>CTFs</li>
<li>Phishing trainings</li>
<li>Computer-based trainings</li>
<li>Role-based trainings</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organizational-security-policies---3rd-party-risk">Organizational Security Policies - 3rd Party Risk</h2>
<p>Elements the go into understanding the <em>structure</em> of third-party risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendors/Business partners</li>
<li>Supply chains</li>
<li>NDAs</li>
</ul>
<p>Contractual vehicles that bind supply chains together:</p>
<ul>
<li>SLAs</li>
<li>MOUs</li>
<li>BPAs (Business Partnership Agreements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam Gordon notes that BPAs basically formalize MOUs into full business relationships.</p>
<p>A new term: Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA). This is the process of determining how much variation occurs in the <em>act of measuring</em> a thing, and how this contributes to our understanding of process variability. Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bias</li>
<li>Linearity</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Repeatability</li>
<li>Reproducibility</li>
</ul>
<p>(It’s not clear here what the difference between “repeatability” and “reproducibility” is here…)</p>
<p>Software/Hardware lifecycle components:</p>
<ul>
<li>End of Life</li>
<li>End of Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that EOS (when security patches are no longer available) comes <em>after</em> EOL (when the system is no longer sold or actively supported). Note that increasingly EOL = EOS (for example, with Chrome OS devices), but this is not <em>always</em> true (Windows…).</p>
<p>PPRR risk management model for third-party &amp; supply chain risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention</li>
<li>Preparedness</li>
<li>Response</li>
<li>Recovery</li>
</ul>
