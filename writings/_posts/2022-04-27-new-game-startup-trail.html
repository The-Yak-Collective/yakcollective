<p>We just launched <a href="http://startuptrail.engine.is/">Startup Trail</a> a new browser-based game where you explore policy issues facing tech startups. Found your company and then navigate a series of thorny dilemmas as you grow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/startuptrail-1200x630.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game was developed as a collaboration between <a href="https://leveragedplay.com/">Leveraged Play</a>, <a href="https://copia.is/">Copia Institute</a>, and <a href="https://www.engine.is/">Engine</a>, as a playful way to explore the issues in Engine’s report <a href="https://www.engine.is/news/category/engine-releases-2022-startup-agenda">Startup Agenda</a>.</p>

<p>We had a blast making this game and we hope you enjoy playing it (and learning something, too).</p>
