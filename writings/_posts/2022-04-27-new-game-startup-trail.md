We just launched [Startup Trail](http://startuptrail.engine.is/) a new browser-based game where you explore policy issues facing tech startups. Found your company and then navigate a series of thorny dilemmas as you grow.

This game was developed as a collaboration between [Leveraged Play](https://leveragedplay.com/), [Copia Institute](https://copia.is/), and [Engine](https://www.engine.is/), as a playful way to explore the issues in Engine’s report [Startup Agenda](https://www.engine.is/news/category/engine-releases-2022-startup-agenda).

We had a blast making this game and we hope you enjoy playing it (and learning something, too).

If you’re interested in commissioning a similar-style game, definitely reach out: randy@leveragedplay.com
