<p><em>For change, management, innovation – for all our futures.</em></p><p>You should listen to this 70-minute work-through of a US council meeting – in Springfield Massachusetts – with a commentary from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAF8kiUB3Vi8mHMB7X7L4JT-UJMBnQFCIJY">Charles Marohn</a> of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/strong-towns/">Strong Towns</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/12/13/two-different-languages">https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/12/13/two-different-languages</a><br><br>Why on earth would you spend over an hour of your life listening to excerpts from a council meeting with commentary from a campaigning engineer?</p><p>Politicians and townsfolk want answers to a problem: people are reliably and predictably getting killed on State Street. That system is broken. And the system of investigating remediation, deciding options, implementing... isn&#39;t fixing it.
