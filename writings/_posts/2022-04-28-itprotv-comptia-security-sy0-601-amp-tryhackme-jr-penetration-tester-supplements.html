<p>Data classification involves the data owner labeling the data in question so that only appropriate people have access to it (with the appropriate privileges).</p>
<p>There’s also data <em>categorization</em>, which is a different but related concept that labels the data in question based on the business impact should it become unavailable.</p>
<p>“Governance” is the “system by which an organization directs and controls IT security” (per ISO 38500). Governance is about <em>who</em> can make decisions, while <em>management</em> is about making decisions to mitigate risk.</p>
<p>Governance is strategic, but management is operational.</p>
<p>Policies (and sometimes procedures) are generally about governance — we’re doing X, and person Y is in charge. The management then becomes the question of <em>how</em> person Y implements X.</p>

<p>“Change management” is the <em>process</em> of implementing and documenting changes, while “change control” encompasses the actual technical controls used to realize this. “Change management” is “all roll-outs must have a roll-back plan”, while the use of git would be a “change control”. The universe of “change controls” is thus a proper subset of the universe of “change management”.</p>

<p>I’m done with the Jr. Penetration Tester learning path, but while I was working on it a number of rooms were mentioned in asides. A few potentially interesting rooms were also released during that time. So before moving on to the <em>next</em> learning path it’s time to mop up some of these “supplemental” rooms.</p>

<p>Once again, the Lockheed Martin kill chain (my paraphrasing):</p>
<ul>
<li>Recon</li>
<li>Weaponize</li>
<li>Deliver</li>
<li>Exploit</li>
<li>Install</li>
<li>Control</li>
<li>Endgame</li>
