## Organizational Security Policies - Data

Data classification involves the data owner labeling the data in question so that only appropriate people have access to it (with the appropriate privileges).

There’s also data _categorization_, which is a different but related concept that labels the data in question based on the business impact should it become unavailable.

“Governance” is the “system by which an organization directs and controls IT security” (per ISO 38500). Governance is about _who_ can make decisions, while _management_ is about making decisions to mitigate risk.

Governance is strategic, but management is operational.

Policies (and sometimes procedures) are generally about governance - we’re doing X, and person Y is in charge. The management then becomes the question of _how_ person Y implements X.

## Organizational Security Policies - Other Areas

“Change management” is the _process_ of implementing and documenting changes, while “change control” encompasses the actual technical controls used to realize this. “Change management” is “all roll-outs must have a roll-back plan”, while the use of git would be a “change control”. The universe of “change controls” is thus a proper subset of the universe of “change management”.

I’m done with the Jr. Penetration Tester learning path, but while I was working on it a number of rooms were mentioned in asides. A few potentially interesting rooms were also released during that time. So before moving on to the _next_ learning path it’s time to mop up some of these “supplemental” rooms.

## Engagement Structure

Once again, the Lockheed Martin kill chain (my paraphrasing):

- Recon
- Weaponize
- Deliver
- Exploit
- Install
- Control
- Endgame
