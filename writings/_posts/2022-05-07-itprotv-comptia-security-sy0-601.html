<h1 id="comptia-security-exam-cram">CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram</h1>
<p>Today I’ll be working through my <em>last</em> reading from the Security+ Exam Cram (chapter 35), “Sensitive Data and Privacy”.</p>
<h2 id="data-sensitivity-labeling-and-handling">Data Sensitivity Labeling and Handling</h2>
<p>Common data classification labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public</li>
<li>Proprietary (normally protected by an NDA)</li>
<li>Private (non-sensitive but confidential information; typically things like employee pay)</li>
<li>Confidential (typically internal-only and need-to-know)</li>
<li>Sensitive (highly damaging if disclosed; a step up in restrictions from confidential)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data often changes its sensitivity level depending on its stage of use (for example, quarterly financials move from sensitive -&gt; public).</p>
<h2 id="privacy-laws-and-regulatory-compliance">Privacy Laws and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that PII, like any kind of data classification, is contextual. A set of data points which is not PII by itself can become PII when combined with other data (deanonymization, etc.).</p>
<p>PHI needs to be protected for 50 years after the individuals death (!!!).</p>
<h2 id="data-roles-and-responsibilities">Data Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Key roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner (determines the data classification level and is bottom-line responsible)</li>
<li>Custodian (implements appropriate controls based upon the data classification determined by the owner)</li>
<li>Privacy Officer (responsible for legal compliance and other risk management)</li>
<li>Controller (GDPR; determines the use of the data)</li>
<li>Processor (GDPR; an entity that processes or otherwise manipulates data).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it’s not uncommon for a single person to have multiple roles w.r.t. a given piece/type of data.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-and-data-sensitivity---breaches--data-types">Privacy and Data Sensitivity - Breaches &amp; Data Types</h2>
<p>Initial steps when containing a data breach:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Re)Secure your operations</li>
<li>Fix exploited vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Internal/Government notifications (legal, law enforcement, regulators)</li>
<li>B2B notifications (vendors, business customers)</li>
<li>Customer/Individual notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>PHI breaches require that the USDHHS be notified, and may trigger mandatory <em>media</em> notifications.</p>
<p>Broad data categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>PII</li>
<li>PHI</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Government/Regulatory</li>
<li>Customer data (non-PII/PHI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Governmental data classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Higher levels, double-secret probation levels)</li>
<li>Top secret</li>
<li>Secret</li>
<li>Confidential</li>
<li>Unclassified</li>
</ul>
<p>Equivalent common business data classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidential</li>
<li>Private</li>
<li>Sensitive</li>
<li>Public</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is to combine <em>both</em> categories and classifications to determine who should have access to a given piece of data.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-data-sensitivity---privacy-enhancing-tech">Privacy and Data Sensitivity - Privacy Enhancing Tech</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data minimization (in both collection <em>and</em> processing)</li>
<li>Masking (use “fake” data, normally for testing)</li>
<li>Tokenization (replace sensitive data with a non-meaningful, <em>possibly</em> reversible, representation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data masking can either be “static” (a completely altered data set) or “deterministic” (mapping “fake” data to the actual data in a one-to-one fashion). Masking sometimes is done one-the-fly when it is transferred between systems (“on-the-fly” masking is called “dynamic” masking when there is no “testing” datastore on the other side, just a process/application of some kind).</p>
<p>Data masking techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Scrambling</li>
<li>Nulling</li>
<li>Value variance (data is replaced by some mapping)</li>
<li>Substitution (like value variance, but care is taken to make the “fake” data realistic)</li>
<li>Shuffling (randomize values <em>within</em> a dataset)</li>
<li>Pseudonymization (any of the above, but with the goal that the link between the data set and the “real world” is broken while <em>maintaining</em> patterns <em>within</em> the data set)</li>
</ul>
<p>The key difference between pseudonymization and anonymization is that the former is theoretically reversible (and may be <em>functionally</em> reversible with access to the original mapping / lookup table), while the latter is not. Anonymization is actually quite difficult for real-world data without purposefully destroying the patterns/relationships within the data set.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-data-sensitivity---roles--responsibilities">Privacy and Data Sensitivity - Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
<p>“Roles” correspond to a particular <em>job</em>, while “responsibilities” correspond to that job’s <em>functions</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject (who’s the data about, anyway?)</li>
<li>Data Protection Offices (GDPR role; responsible for training, auditing internal processes, and acting as the governmental point-of-contact)</li>
<li>Owner (holds legal rights/controls over the data and is responsible for data categorization and classification)</li>
<li>Custodian (responsible for dats custody, transport, storage, etc.)</li>
<li>Steward (responsible for ensuring that data is fit for purpose &amp; is handled in a manner compliant with corporate policies, government regulations, etc.)</li>
<li>Controller (determines the why and how data will be processed, subject to the owner’s classification/direction)</li>
<li>Processor (whoever’s actually processing the data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-and-data-sensitivity---other-areas">Privacy and Data Sensitivity - Other Areas</h2>
<p>Information lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Store</li>
<li>Use (by the creator/owner)</li>
<li>Share (with others)</li>
<li>Archive</li>
<li>Destroy</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that “use” and “share” are optional steps, and one or both may actually not happen.</p>
<p>A “privacy impact assessment” is just an assessment covering how PII is collected, used, shared, and maintained… And what the <em>impact</em> to the business would be should any of these processes have a CIA breakdown. The goal is to make sure that privacy protections are integrated into the entire SDLC.</p>
<p>A “privacy notice” is the externally-facing version/description of a “privacy policy”.</p>
