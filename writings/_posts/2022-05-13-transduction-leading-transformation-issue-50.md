 I’ve been wanting for some time to write and post something about the distinction Jonathan Horwitz — who I’ve been lucky enough to learn from — makes between his time in the anti-War movement, and his time in the Peace movement. A couple of weeks ago, he did it better than I ever could, because it’s his story.
