<p>More notes today from Linux Academy’s “AWS Essentials” YouTube playlist.</p>

<h3 id="object-lifecycles">Object Lifecycles</h3>
<p>An “object lifecycle” is a set of rules in S3 that migrate objects between storage classes (or even delete them!) based on the age of an object.</p>

<h3 id="permissions">Permissions</h3>
<p>Permissions granted to (non-admin) users (at the individual/group level) or resources (at the individual/role level) only apply to <em>using</em> a service in AWS. Permissioning for object create in a given service is still handled at the object level.</p>
<p>For example, giving a group full access to S3 <em>doesn’t</em> give the members of that group access to any of the buckets created in S3 by other users in the account — <em>that</em> access must be applied at the bucket level.</p>
<p>Note that making a bucket public is <em>not</em> enough to make its contents viewable outside of the AWS account — there still needs to be a permission grant to “everyone” that makes the object/folder/etc. downloadable. (My take-away from this is that making an S3 bucket public is essentially changing the definition of “everyone” from “everyone in the current AWS account” to “<em>everyone</em> everyone”.)</p>

<h3 id="object-versioning">Object Versioning</h3>
<p>Note that suspending versioning <em>doesn’t</em> delete old versions — it simply stops the creation of new object versions in that bucket. (And yes — once you’ve <em>enabled</em> versioning for a bucket, you cannot disable it. Versioning can only be ”suspended”.)</p>
<p>Be aware that new object versions do <em>not</em> inherit the original version’s storage class — that’s set per object (even per versioned object).</p>

<h3 id="ec2-basics">EC2 Basics</h3>
<p>EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud</p>
<p>In addition to “on-demand” and ”reserved” instances, Amazon also has “spot” instances that are sold using an auction-like mechanism. The “spot” price fluctuates based on how much capacity is currently unused in EC2. When the spot price is at or below your “bid”, you <em>automatically</em> get a spot instance configured and provisioned (at the cost is your bid). When the spot price <em>exceeds</em> your bid, your instance is <em>automatically</em> terminated and re-allocated to users with a higher bid. So spot instances <em>can</em> be cheap, but access is unreliable (and becomes more so during peak usage periods).</p>

<h3 id="amazon-machine-images-amis">Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</h3>
<p>An AMI is basically just a templated VM with some configuration knobs. (Mostly these knobs are about ”pre-installing” applications and setting up desired configurations. In practice, this translates to kicking off scripts during the AMI’s first run that <em>actually</em> install and configure things for you.)</p>
