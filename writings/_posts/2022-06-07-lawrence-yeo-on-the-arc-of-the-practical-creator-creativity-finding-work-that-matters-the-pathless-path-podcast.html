<p>Being an undeclared major till his senior year of college, Lawrence didn’t really know what he wanted to do. After looking up which jobs make the most money, he decided to declare as an economics major, leading him to explore Investment Banking. While he didn’t end up working in investment banking, he was still pulled by the power of prestige, something he says “is a drug, and is most potent” when you are young and looking at schools. </p>



<p>Over a number of years and experiments with music and creating and writing, he slowly started to figure out a better path forward for him. After leaving the corporate world for a second time, Lawrence finally found a calling &#8211; writing on his blog: <a href="https://moretothat.com/">More To That</a> where he uses visual storytelling to express his ideas of pursuing alternative paths, sharing ideas, and creating online.&nbsp;</p>

Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.  <a href=https://think-boundless.com/the-pathless-path/>Learn More & Buy The Book Here</a></p>
