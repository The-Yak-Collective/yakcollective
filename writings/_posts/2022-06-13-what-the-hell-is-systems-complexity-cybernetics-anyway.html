<p>UPDATE — slides, video, notes now in edited post at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_systems-convening-systems-practice-systems-activity-6942014940794789888-c6He">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_systems-convening-systems-practice-systems-activity-6942014940794789888-c6He</a></p><p>Today I’m doing a one-hour talk (see <a href="https://q.health.org.uk/event/systems-convening-systems-thinking-and-systems-practice-with-ben-taylor/">https://q.health.org.uk/event/systems-convening-systems-thinking-and-systems-practice-with-ben-taylor/</a> — you can still join if you see this when I publish — and you can see the board at <a href="https://bit.ly/systems3board">bit.ly/systems3board</a> at any time) on how systems practices and systems thinking can link in to the wonderful social learning that Bev and Etienne Weger-Trayner identified in their Systems Convening book.</p><p>They discovered people who make a difference:</p><p>“You may not have heard about them; what they do is rarely in their job description. You may not even be aware of what they do; they tend to act as enablers rather than taking credit or seeking the spotlight. But they are here — working on sustainable change, across challenging silos, in complex social landscapes, amid changing circumstances. We call them systems conveners.</p><p>“Their stance is both visionary and pragmatic. They look at the social landscape in which they operate — an organization, a city, a community, a country, the world — and they see unrealized potential that exists across traditional boundaries and silos.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fEWce8vgnMBQww5g" /></figure><p>So I had to try to define, again, what ‘systems thinking’ is for me.</p><p>This is what I came up with:</p><p>I start from two of my favourite quotes:</p><p>‘To understand is to know what to do’ Wittgenstein</p><p>‘I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of which story or stories do I find myself a part?’ MacIntyre</p><p>So. In a world of complexity, with coexisting nebulosity and pattern, that can be interpreted in unlimited ways and only partially controlled…</p><p>• distinctions, framings, ways of seeing emerge and allow us to make sense of things,</p><p>• to make the complexity manageable,</p><p>• and generate meaning and value, purpose, and legitimacy, power, and ethics.</p><p>• We shape our world, and our world shapes us.</p><p>• This means setting what we see and don’t see, the (un)discussable, cues for behaviour, etc.</p><p>Yet, the complexity, nebulosity and pattern, and multiple interpretability remain.</p><p>• Feedback can create learning shocks — what we thought, was wrong.</p><p>• The natural development or results of our ways of seeing and being can seem undesirable.</p><p>• Our existing multiple worlds of meaning can create conflict, exploitation, and confusion.</p><p>• And people have agency; they can never be fully predicted or controlled.</p><p>We can learn. To act differently, to reframe, to change our identity.</p><p>For me, systems | complexity | cybernetics is about working with this.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Join the discussion on LinkedIn — with link to all the materials, video etc <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_systems-convening-systems-practice-systems-activity-6942014940794789888-c6He">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_systems-convening-systems-practice-systems-activity-6942014940794789888-c6He</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=58ca4420d4aa" width="1" height="1" alt="">
