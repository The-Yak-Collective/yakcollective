<p>There are two types of indie consultants. There are those that have created a very clear specialization, you can look at their website and see something like <em>“I help B2B SaaS companies with their content strategy”</em> or <em>“I help brands build audience via email”</em>. The indie consultants that do this well seem very busy, well known and respected in their industry. It’s fairly easy to see from the outside what their work looks.</p>
