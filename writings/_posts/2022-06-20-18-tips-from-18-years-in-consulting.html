<h3>What lessons would you pass on about your industry, given the chance?</h3><p>Here are 18 I put together….</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt;Sales and growth<br></strong>1. Sales is a profession — but should never be separated from delivery, or you will sell what cannot be delivered</p><p>2. Most sales happen through relationships, especially with happy clients</p><p>3. Be opportunistic, strategically — growth usually comes (despite strategic plans), from building on success. Often the trick is forming teams and propositions when you have just enough consistent demand in a new area.</p><p>4. Some instincts of consultants for sales and profit are wrong.<br>It’s better commercially that clients respect you than like you.<br>And don’t expect to be paid more for the hard work of intellectual struggle and innovation!</p><p>5. It is probably impossible to properly ‘scale’ a true consulting firm<br> <br><strong>&gt;&gt;Organise for growth<br></strong>6. Love love love your people — they are the offer and the product! Almost always the rare disastrous projects come from lack of clear expectation and boundary setting with consultants and/or customers.</p><p>7. Clients and consultancies need a single neck to wring — you need real clarity of accountability</p><p>8. Operations is complex and too easily dismissed</p><p>9. The external client / internal business focus should be 90/10; it’s tempting to make it 10/90</p><p>10. One business model at a time: it’s *very* hard to mix ‘selling existing products’ with ‘responding to client/market demand’<br> <br><strong>&gt;&gt;Delivery (for growth)<br></strong>11. Having senior people review work can really drive quality — and/or misery</p><p>12. Drive project delivery — start fast, and panic early and often to power towards your project goals</p><p>13. Consult to the context if you possibly can — it’s usually the client context that will kill your project, not your delivery within the ‘project box’</p><p>14. A lot of consultancy success is about gaining recognition of your credentials and authority — preferably implicitly, through proving it</p><p>15. Be really persistent in engaging, exiting, following up</p><p><strong>&gt;Be aware of the pressures of the space of service<br></strong>16. As a consultant, you know less than the client, they expect a lot, and they can kick you out. The temptation is to try to be of immediate use by lecturing them or being a servant.<br>Hold back, so you can learn together with the client…</p><p><strong>&gt;Live in the swamp<br></strong>17. Understand that it’s messy in human organisations. Try to make it clear and simple when you can — but no simpler than it is.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w38kD4Ll9vDYBYJFOzquUg.png" /></figure><p><strong>&gt;Play beautiful football<br></strong>18. It matters very much how you do what you do.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*WYYs4BCrUVKKy1R1.png" /></figure><p>I’ve been an official consultant since 2004, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pwc/">PwC</a>, setting up a new thing inside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/capita/">Capita</a>, and co-founding <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/redquadrant/">RedQuadrant</a> in 2009, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-public-service-transformation-academy/">The Public Service Transformation Academy</a> in 2016.
