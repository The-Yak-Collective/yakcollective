### Coεmeta Public Work Log 2022.1.MSU — Cultivation & Harvest Szn

#### Midsummer Solstice Update (6/21/2022): building capacity, sowing & reaping in work & relation

> _This is the second_ [_Public Work Log_](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) _entry for_ [_Coεmeta_](https://coemeta.xyz/)_, a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It’s intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of_ [_working in public_](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)_, contributing to_ [_knowledge commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)_, “finding the others” & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to_ [_reach out_](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) _at any time, I’m happy to help however I can!_

_- Daniel McNichol_, founder & Chief Data Scientist

_This post is an excerpt of the full versions available at:_ [**_Github_**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md) _(primary source & version control) &_ [**_Roam_**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/mkxDLqzZy) _(navigable outline format)_

- _comments, forks & pull requests are welcome!_

_It complements our_ [_Open Source Strategy repo_](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_, which offers more discrete, version-controlled resources related to the strategies & frameworks discussed here in more narrative form._

### 📜 Prologue: backstory & antecedents

#### Backstory

_Coεmeta_ is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):

> a more **balanced, integrated, enriching & impactful** life in **greater community**

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka “infinitely”), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

> (My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a [worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) or [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & partnerships with other “self-sovereign” _ᵋ_ groups or entities. This is part of the “in greater community” aspect of the metagame.)

So Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional ‘venture’ or typical small business or startup etc, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [previous log entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of the first two entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)

ᵋ NB: I’m generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized “[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)”, but “independent” isn’t quite adequate either.

#### Antecedents & adumbration

In the [previous entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md), I [discussed](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#vibe-check) feeling good about finding some of the greater balance I was seeking, along with a more integrated, rewarding & palpably impactful work life. I discussed my gratitude for this provisional success, which was mostly due to luck & the kindness of others. And I mentioned looking forward to shifting to more of an outward focus, enabling clients & collaborators to be more impactful, & growing mutual capacities together.

In this entry, I’m happy to report on some progress towards that outward focus & mutual capacity-building, as well as new opportunities again arising primarily from luck & the kindness of others.

I also discuss how some of that prior balance has given way to seizing these opportunities (or at least has been stretched over a longer timescale). I also note a growing salience of looming risks & shadows, but how I’m nevertheless looking forward to continued cultivation & harvest, & wrestling with ideas of further scaling (or sporing) these efforts for greater impact & a greater common good.

### ⏳ Timeline

#### (This content is too long to navigate without the ability to collapse & expand sections, so see the full version on [**_Github_**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md) _or _[**_Roam_**](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/mkxDLqzZy))

### ꩜ Coda: eval & checkout

#### Eval

I’m keeping the raw scorekeeping & evaluation metrics out of these posts in favor of a more narrative & vibey approach. And to be frank I still haven’t further developed or formalized my metrics framework, partly due to lack of time, partly due to lack of need: things are going well at a high-level & there’s not much more to evaluate. _(resist_ [_vanity metrics_](https://learn.g2.com/vanity-metrics)_!)_

But a few snapshots of my provisional metric tracking make that story pretty clear:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*UGag2C5mKfitnD3p.png)
_I’ve more than doubled my original freelance work targets, more or less kept pace with relational & toolmaking work targets (albeit somewhat perfunctorily), all mostly at the expense of content work (& unpictured: social poasting & engagement, on which I’ve got some updated takes in store…)._

And while my [Q1 OKRs](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/okrs.md) landed in a solid place, [Q2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdBfK9FYPXAVAoHKcvjufuq5_6Hso2KmdGZGU8ChG8g/edit?usp=sharing) …not so much, mostly due to lack of need (or capacity) for further revenue experiments — plus content creation, social posting, & peer-collaboration getting crowded out by the sudden spike in client demand (which has been greater than planned since month 2 of this journey — for which I’m fortunate & grateful!).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*09FKFsXL_oiVfkbg.png)

This is a situation where I might revise OKR targets to reflect changing circumstances, or score some KRs \> 100% during evaluation to reflect the overperformance in some areas which resulted in corresponding underperformance in others. But ultimately I still consider these all valid goals in the long term, & expect things to even out over the longer time-average.

#### Vibe Check

So getting to the vibe check…:

- I still feel really good, & immensely appreciative of my good fortune so far in this journey
- _…if a bit more tired, & more alert to potential looming risks on the horizon_

Some of the [greater balance](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#vibe-check) attained last quarter has given way to the longer days of cultivation & harvest season, & longer shadows have been cast by the growing sun:

- _recession risks, inflation, war & its_ [_nth-order effects_](https://medium.com/paloit/second-order-effect-in-product-design-and-strategy-82c7fd2c52e6) _on food production & supply chains during an ongoing global pandemic, in a time of generally high volatility & civil turmoil, etc._

So I’m not taking Coεmeta’s [salad days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days) for granted, or expecting any sort of new [long peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana).

[_History never ended_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man) except for the [airport literati](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1508545718524551169).

### Daniel Coεmeta McNichol on Twitter: "The End of History is popsci lol airport litplz be serious / Twitter"

The End of History is popsci lol airport litplz be serious

But I _am_ making the most of current opportunities & cherishing the greater independence, the variety of work itself, accelerated learning, & more palpable impact. All while staying humble in the face of unknowable & risk-laden future trajectories, maintaining alertness & requisite [optionality](https://thedeepdish.org/optionality-book/), keeping the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) looping & the [strategy emergent](https://alliedmedia.org/speaker-projects/emergent-strategy-ideation-institute).

I look forward to building on current momentum & leveraging this harvest for continued mutual capacity-building & an eventual return to [planned vectors of more scalable & social work & impact](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md), whether via _scaling or sporing_.

Which is all to say… the [infinite game](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.1.msu.md#backstory) is made for playing, so _game-on_.
