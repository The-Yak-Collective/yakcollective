<p>Hannah is awesome and you should listen to this podcast. &nbsp;She grew up homeschooled, is an endlessly curious person, has a deep sense of agency, and is a pro at carving her own path. &nbsp;She&#8217;s done a ton of things including writing, coaching, and working at startups and has created jobs for herself, negotiated working remotely (before it was cool), and has done a ton of other things. &nbsp;She recently founded Rebel Educator which is a media brand that aims to share more about homeschooling and alternative education with a broader audience online.</p>

Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.  <a href=https://think-boundless.com/the-pathless-path/>Learn More & Buy The Book Here</a></p>
