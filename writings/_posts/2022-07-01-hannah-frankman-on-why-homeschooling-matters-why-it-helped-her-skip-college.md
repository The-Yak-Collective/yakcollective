Hannah is awesome and you should listen to this podcast.  She grew up homeschooled, is an endlessly curious person, has a deep sense of agency, and is a pro at carving her own path.  She’s done a ton of things including writing, coaching, and working at startups and has created jobs for herself, negotiated working remotely (before it was cool), and has done a ton of other things.  She recently founded Rebel Educator which is a media brand that aims to share more about homeschooling and alternative education with a broader audience online.

**Just published!** The Pathless Path is Paul's book about walking away from a "perfect" job with a promising future and starting over again. Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.
