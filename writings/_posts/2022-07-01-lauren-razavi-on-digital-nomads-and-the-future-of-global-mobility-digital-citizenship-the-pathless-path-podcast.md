Lauren and I first talked when I was locked down in Taiwan in 2021.  It was amazing to connect with another nomad and writer after weeks of not seeing people.  I was also a bit stuck in my book writing process and she gave me a ton of helpful hints to take my book to the next level.

I was excited to interview Lauren because she just finished her own book, Global Natives about her own experience as a nomad (since 2013!) and also the past, present, and future of the movement.  I think she is one of the most thoughtful perspectives on the future of work and global mobility.

Currently, Lauren is Executive Director of [Plumia](https://plumia.org/), the mission to build an internet country for digital nomads at SafetyWing, a Y Combinator company that raised a $35 million Series B in 2022. She is also author of the book [Global Natives](https://www.holloway.com/b/global-natives) and writes the [Counterflows newsletter](https://lraz.io/newsletter/)) about borderless living. She tweets [@LaurenRazavi](https://twitter.com/LaurenRazavi).

**Just published!** The Pathless Path is Paul's book about walking away from a "perfect" job with a promising future and starting over again. Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.
