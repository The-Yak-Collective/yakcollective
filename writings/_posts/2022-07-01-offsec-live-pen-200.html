<p>Another way of thinking of reverse vs. bind shells - who’s serving the local shell? <em>That’s</em> the system that’s being attacked. Look at the <em>other</em> system: If that system is listening then it’s a reverse shell, and if it’s connecting out then it’s a bind shell.</p>

<p>In the Burp Suite Intruder, you can use the “Recursive Grep” to extract the values from the <em>previous</em> request to use in the current request. Note that this is not compatible with using multiple threads.</p>
