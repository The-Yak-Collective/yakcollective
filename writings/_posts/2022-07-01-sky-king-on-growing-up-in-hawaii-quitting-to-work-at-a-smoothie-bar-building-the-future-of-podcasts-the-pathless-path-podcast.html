<p>This episode is with Sky King, the founder of Modern Stoa, a podcast advertising company <strong>for </strong>podcasters. His path is fascinating &#8211; he grew up in Hawaii, rarely wore shoes, was heavily influenced by Asian culture, had a father who was retired, and somehow ended up in a massive corporation right after college.  In 2016. he became fascinated by how the media was shaping the 2016 US election and decided it was time to act.  From a cold email to Ryan Holiday to helping build Aubrey Marcus&#8217; podcast, Sky was on his way.  His long-term vision is to build an alternative to traditional advertising in audio.</p>



<p>We talk about this and a lot more including:</p>



<ul><li>Why he quit a good job to work at a smoothie bar</li><li>How a cold email to Ryan Holiday changed his life</li><li>Working for Aubrey Marcus</li><li>Buckminster Fuller</li><li>Growing up in Hawaii</li><li>Serendipitous events that lend to him moving to Austin</li><li>The future of Audio</li></ul>

Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries, and a deep dive into the history of our work beliefs, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to what he calls "the pathless path" - a new story for thinking about work in our lives.  <a href=https://think-boundless.com/the-pathless-path/>Learn More & Buy The Book Here</a></p>
