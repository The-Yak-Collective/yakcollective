This episode is with Sky King, the founder of Modern Stoa, a podcast advertising company **for** podcasters. His path is fascinating – he grew up in Hawaii, rarely wore shoes, was heavily influenced by Asian culture, had a father who was retired, and somehow ended up in a massive corporation right after college.  In 2016. he became fascinated by how the media was shaping the 2016 US election and decided it was time to act.  From a cold email to Ryan Holiday to helping build Aubrey Marcus’ podcast, Sky was on his way.  His long-term vision is to build an alternative to traditional advertising in audio.

We talk about this and a lot more including:

- Why he quit a good job to work at a smoothie bar
- How a cold email to Ryan Holiday changed his life
- Working for Aubrey Marcus
- Buckminster Fuller
- Growing up in Hawaii
- Serendipitous events that lend to him moving to Austin
- The future of Audio
