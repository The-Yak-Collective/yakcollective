<p>Today I’ll be starting the ~6 hour “AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials” course as I continue to dive deeper into AWS.</p>
<p>REFERENCES:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-amazon-web-services">Introduction to Amazon Web Services</h2>
<p>Wait… AWS has per-minute satellite rental?!?</p>
<h2 id="compute-in-the-cloud">Compute in the Cloud</h2>
<p>Instance types:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Pupose</li>
<li>Compute Optimized</li>
<li>Memory Optimized</li>
<li>Accelerated Computing</li>
<li>Storage Optimized</li>
</ul>
<p>“Accelerated computing” here means “<em>hardware</em> accelerated computing”. So, high-end GPUs, cryptographic accelerators, custom AI/ML chips, etc.</p>
<p>”Storage optimized” instances aren’t necessarily designed to support a lot of local storage (though the can, and often do, this), but are rather designed to support for high data throughput for that local storage.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-options">Pricing Options</h3>
<ul>
<li>On-Demand (the default model)</li>
<li>Savings Plan (commit to a certain numbers of <em>hours</em> of compute time; can include services like Lambda, and usage above the agreed-upon amount is charged at the regular rate)</li>
<li>Reserved Instances (commit to a certain number of <em>instances</em>)</li>
<li>Spot Instances (additional capacity purchased on the spot market; can be reclaimed by AWS with a 2 minute warning)</li>
<li>Dedicate Hosts (single-account hosts, mostly for high security/compliance workloads)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the “savings plan” and “reserved instances” offer similar savings, but over different metrics.</p>
<h3 id="elastic-load-balancers">Elastic Load Balancers</h3>
<p>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) handles both load balancing <em>between</em> regions (based on regional capacity and the proximity of a request to a particular region) and <em>within</em> regions (by distributing load uniformly between all instances in a region).</p>
<p>ELB doesn’t just have to be client facing, however — it can also be used between the front-end and back-end systems in an architecture.</p>
<h3 id="messaging-and-queueing">Messaging and Queueing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple Queue Service (SQS) — Queue/Buffer messages from one service to another <em>within</em> AWS</li>
<li>Simple Notification Service (SNS) — Queue/Buffer messages from a service in AWS to another service that may be <em>inside of or outside of</em> AWS (and could be directly user-facing, like SMS or push notifications)</li>
</ul>
<p>SQS is a pure machine-to-machine buffer, while SNS is based around a one-to-many pub/sub model.</p>
<h3 id="additional-compute-services">Additional Compute Services</h3>
<p>Amazon’s two container <em>management</em> services are ECS (Elastic Container Service) for Docker and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for Kubernetes. These must be paired with an underlying platform where the containers will actually run — either EC2 (for traditional containerization) or “Fargate” (which functions in a “serverless” fashion like Lambda).</p>
