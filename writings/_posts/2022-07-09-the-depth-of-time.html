<p><em>This research note is part of the <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-clockless-clock">Clockless Clock</a> book project and may turn into a chapter.</em></p><p>We often talk of &#8220;deep time,&#8221; especially in the context of time scales that are extremely long relative to the human lifespan, such as geological or astronomical time scales. But why <em>deep</em>? </p><p>Time, or at least Cartesian time, is famously supposed to be one-dimensional. It is usually understood via a spatial metaphor in terms of a point &#8220;now&#8221; position along a single forward/backward dimension. </p><p>What is this orthogonal &#8220;depth&#8221; dimension? And how does &#8220;deep time&#8221; relate to the other popular notion of the &#8220;long now&#8221;?<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> </p><p>Are adjectives like <em>deep</em> and <em>long </em>merely about adding some poetry to a one-dimensional experience of time, or do they point to, and reify, meaningful aspects of the phenomenology of that experience?</p><p>An idea from optics called <em>depth of field, </em>suitably generalized,<em> </em>helps us think about this question. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">depth of field</a> of a lens is the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be in acceptably sharp focus <em>together</em>. We can think about deep time by constructing an analogous notion of a <em>temporal </em>depth of field, which will then allow us to construct a coherent notion of &#8220;length&#8221; for <em>now</em>. </p><p>To peek ahead, think of the temporal depth of field as the distance<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> between the slowest and fastest processes of change <em>that you can attend to simultaneously</em>. </p><p>If you could simultaneously attend to the flapping of a hummingbird&#8217;s wings and the drift of the tectonic plate under your feet (assuming there isn&#8217;t an earthquake going on right now), you&#8217;d have an extraordinarily high temporal depth of field. </p><p>This understanding allows us to characterize the &#8220;long now&#8221; as well &#8212; it is an experience of now-ness during which we attend to reality with an unusually high temporal depth of field. We can also define a corresponding notion of a &#8220;short now&#8221; that features a high temporal depth of field past the lower limits of our biological capacities, such as nanoseconds to microseconds. <em>Matrix </em>bullet-dodging time is an example (unfortunately fictional) of &#8220;deep time&#8221; at the ultrashort end of now. </p><p>Why should we care about deep time? Because cultivating a greater temporal depth of field, and being able to vary the length of &#8220;now&#8221; from ultrashort to ultralong, makes the experience of time richer and more vivid. You&#8217;ve probably already had accidental tastes of this &#8212; perhaps a sudden, momentary sense of ineffable precious depth while contemplating a historical artifact or astronomical image. Or an intense stab of delicious nostalgia upon being exposed to a particular smell, redolent of childhood memories. Or a moment of an empathy for an insect embarking on what to it must be a long journey across the living room. These are long-now and short-now glimpses of deep time, and it is possible to systematically cultivate our ability to sense it. </p>
