<p>Today I’ll be covering the “Security” module of the “AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials” course.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="shared-responsibility">Shared Responsibility</h1>
<p>A good way of describing the shared security model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS is responsible for security <em>of</em> the cloud, while customers are responsible for security <em>in</em> the cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rudy Chetty, “AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, “AWS phone support scams” are a thing.</p>
<h1 id="user-permissions">User Permissions</h1>
<p>Only the permissions for a single role are in effect at any one time.</p>
<h1 id="aws-organizations">AWS Organizations</h1>
<p>AWS accounts are commonly used to provide hard(er) permission boundaries between teams and application functions.</p>
<p>“Organizations” provides a “meta account” feature (called the “root” account) that can centralize billing and enforce features <em>within</em> the member accounts.</p>
<p>Within organizations, accounts can be grouped using an OU model.</p>
<p>Permissions are enforced using “service control policies (SCPs), which enable/disable services/APIs and can set permission ceilings. SCPs can be applied to individual accounts or to entire OUs.</p>
<p>Note that SCPs do <em>not</em> apply directly to IAM objects. Instead, think of them as providing limits that those IAM objects (and the account’s root user!) must operate within.</p>
<h1 id="compliance">Compliance</h1>
<p>AWS compliance reports and agreements are consolidated into a single portal, called “Artifact”.</p>
<h1 id="ddos-attacks">DDoS Attacks</h1>
<p>DDoS attacks and associated AWS mitigations:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP Flood, Reflection Attacks -&gt; Security Groups</li>
<li>Slowloris -&gt; Elastic Load Balancer</li>
<li>Targeted Attacks -&gt; AWS Shield / WAF</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="additional-security-services">Additional Security Services</h1>
<p>AWS Inspector is a service that can audit an AWS account configuration and report on deviations from baseline best practices.</p>
<p>GuardDuty is an AWS-centric threat hunting solution (sounds a bit like a SIEM). GuardDuty can be hooked into AWS Lambda to automate response based on the signals it detects.</p>
