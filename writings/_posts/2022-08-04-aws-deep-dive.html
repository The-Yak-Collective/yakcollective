<p>Today I’ll be covering the “Pricing and Support” module from the “AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials” course.</p>

<h1 id="free-tier">Free Tier</h1>
<p>There are ~60 services in AWS with a free tier of some sort.</p>
<p>AWS has three classes of free tier: “Always free” (Lambda up to 1 million calls per month, etc.), 12 months free (EC2, within limits; note that the clock on services in this category starts ticking <em>as soon as you sign up for an AWS account</em>), and free trials of various lengths.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-billing">Consolidated Billing</h1>
<p>Organizations can include at most 4 accounts by default; adding more requires reaching out to AWS support.</p>
<p>When billing is consolidated within Organizations, <em>bulk usage</em> is also consolidated. This means that discounts can become available for <em>all</em> accounts if the organization’s <em>total</em> usage qualifies. (It’s left unsaid, but the implication here is that free tier quotas will also be consolidated.)</p>
<p>When an organization qualifies for a bulk discount, the benefits of that discount are distributed to the component accounts in proportion to their usage.</p>
<h1 id="budgets">Budgets</h1>
<p>AWS budget information updates every 8 hours.</p>
<h1 id="cost-explorer">Cost Explorer</h1>
<p>This is basically an application that allows billing data to be aggregated and displayed in various ways, as well as compared across time.</p>
<h1 id="support-plans">Support Plans</h1>
<p>Support tiers: Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise.</p>
<p>Only Enterprise gets an account manager.</p>
<p>Only Business and Enterprise get full access to all Trusted Advisor checks.</p>
