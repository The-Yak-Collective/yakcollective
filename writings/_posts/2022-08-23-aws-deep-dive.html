<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UP7wDBjZ37o">AWS re:Invent 2016: DNS Demystified - Amazon Route 53 (YouTube)</a></p>
<p>Route 53 has a 100% SLA (!!!).</p>
<p>Route 53 can resolve to geographically close hosts, handle failover, etc. All the things you would expect a DNS system hosted by Amazon to be able to do with Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>Route 53 supports ALIAS/ANAME for A records.</p>
<p>Route 53 breaks up nameservers between clients in a similar fashion to AWS’s back-end networking HyperPlane nodes (see my notes about AWS VPCs from 2022-08-20) - nameservers <em>are</em> shared between customers, but no two customers have the same <em>set</em> of nameservers.</p>
<p>Route 53 can also be used to set up internal DNS for VPCs. Internal DNS has all of the features of Route 53’s external DNS, and as a bonus can use arbitrary TLDs.</p>
<p>Route 53 features a graphical interface for designing DNS routing rules (should a user get routed based on geographic proximity, fastest connection, and so on? how should server failover be handled? etc.), called “Traffic Flow”.</p>
