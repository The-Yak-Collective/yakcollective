<p>I’m definitely in a lull with writing posts. What would you do next, if you were me?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*NVEq99mywe20ItTG" /></figure><p>For the last two or three years, I’ve been very disciplined about writing one or two intentional LinkedIn psts every week (Monday and/or Wednesday), and then pulling them together with a bunch of the things I’ve shared on Twitter and the Systems Community of Inquiry over the weekend and sending that out as a newsletter. And (as well as Revue and other sites), everything is also located on my blog.</p><p>It is, frankly, an odd thing to do. To write not to a fixed audience but with the intention of being widely seen and shared and discussed — but to stick resolutely to obtuse topics of personal obsession — systems | complexity | cybernetics, (public) service transformation, consulting/change and ‘misc’ (deep history, human liberation, inspiring music, and generally the poetry and passion of insight) — well, that’s perverse.</p><p>I have certainly made a commitment to ‘stubbornness with regard to the once-chosen path’.</p><p>What it has done is to sharpen (I think) my writing and my thinking, and open up all kinds of engagement I wouldn’t otherwise have had.</p><p>I think I’ve avoided the hard sell, banging on tediously about hang-ups or frustrations — or being *too* political.</p><p>And while I’m very backed up with client work, running my business, other commitments, and I have an enormous trove of unreleased podcasts, a nearly finished book or two, some amazing collaboration offers — all suffering due to lack of time — mostly doing the posts gives me more energy and inspiration to get things done.</p><p>Partly I’ve just got lazy about identifying ideas that really tickle me to be prepared to write the posts. Partly I’ve shared a lot of core material already, and don’t want to just be recycling it. And partly life has got in the way.</p><p>So… something may need to come next. I might go quiet, I might change tack. Most likely I’ll pop up on Wednesday with a post on some workshop warm-up exercise with allusions to systems thinking :-D</p><p>So, in this edition — <strong>Australasian Change Days 2022</strong> where I’m speaking THIS WEEK. And from #freethinkerscorner — where I’m also speaking THIS WEEK if we can get dates and times to align (it’s admirably last-minute :-))</p><p>One piece from the last week, a few links from my tweets and many more from syscoi.com.</p><p>And a bunch of my ‘greatest hits’ LinkedIn posts.</p><h3>This week</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*Eo83bLZSr9rWUmgv" /></figure><p><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2022/08/31/what-are-the-blogs-or-social-media-which-you-learned-the-most-from-early-on/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>What are the blogs or social media which you learned the most from, early on?</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://chosen-path.org/2022/08/31/what-are-the-blogs-or-social-media-which-you-learned-the-most-from-early-on/"><strong>chosen-path.org</strong></a> <br> A recent comment from Mike Parker had me thinking about #systemsthinking Twitter, in the early days — a great little community of folks sharing, learning, and debating together.
