I’m definitely in a lull with writing posts. What would you do next, if you were me?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*NVEq99mywe20ItTG)

For the last two or three years, I’ve been very disciplined about writing one or two intentional LinkedIn psts every week (Monday and/or Wednesday), and then pulling them together with a bunch of the things I’ve shared on Twitter and the Systems Community of Inquiry over the weekend and sending that out as a newsletter. And (as well as Revue and other sites), everything is also located on my blog.

It is, frankly, an odd thing to do. To write not to a fixed audience but with the intention of being widely seen and shared and discussed — but to stick resolutely to obtuse topics of personal obsession — systems | complexity | cybernetics, (public) service transformation, consulting/change and ‘misc’ (deep history, human liberation, inspiring music, and generally the poetry and passion of insight) — well, that’s perverse.

I have certainly made a commitment to ‘stubbornness with regard to the once-chosen path’.

What it has done is to sharpen (I think) my writing and my thinking, and open up all kinds of engagement I wouldn’t otherwise have had.

I think I’ve avoided the hard sell, banging on tediously about hang-ups or frustrations — or being \*too\* political.

And while I’m very backed up with client work, running my business, other commitments, and I have an enormous trove of unreleased podcasts, a nearly finished book or two, some amazing collaboration offers — all suffering due to lack of time — mostly doing the posts gives me more energy and inspiration to get things done.

Partly I’ve just got lazy about identifying ideas that really tickle me to be prepared to write the posts. Partly I’ve shared a lot of core material already, and don’t want to just be recycling it. And partly life has got in the way.

So… something may need to come next. I might go quiet, I might change tack. Most likely I’ll pop up on Wednesday with a post on some workshop warm-up exercise with allusions to systems thinking :-D

So, in this edition —  **Australasian Change Days 2022** where I’m speaking THIS WEEK. And from #freethinkerscorner — where I’m also speaking THIS WEEK if we can get dates and times to align (it’s admirably last-minute :-))

One piece from the last week, a few links from my tweets and many more from syscoi.com.

And a bunch of my ‘greatest hits’ LinkedIn posts.

### This week

 A recent comment from Mike Parker had me thinking about #systemsthinking Twitter, in the early days — a great little community of folks sharing, learning, and debating together. Then there was Gene Bellinger’s original Systems Thinking group here on LinkedIn (which I merged my group into) — which still continues in new form at [https://lnkd.in/dMB3xvRz,](https://lnkd.in/dMB3xvRz,) and is slightly being … [Continue reading What are the blogs or social media which you learned the most from, early on? →](https://chosen-path.org/2022/08/31/what-are-the-blogs-or-social-media-which-you-learned-the-most-from-early-on/)
