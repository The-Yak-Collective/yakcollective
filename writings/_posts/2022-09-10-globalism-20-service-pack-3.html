<p>I just landed in India, transiting via Singapore, where I had a long layover. Since I last transited through Singapore in 2018, they've built a weird egg-shaped pseudo-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology">arcology<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></a> called <a href="https://www.jewelchangiairport.com/en.html">Jewel</a> right next to Changi airport. It feels like a preview of what Neom might be like if that ever gets built, except of course it screams Southeast-Asian Consumerism rather than Middle-Eastern Despotism. The digital surfaces of Jewel (the website, app etc) are an explosion of discount promotions, deals, and advertising. The thing itself is a hypertrophied <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/779098">junkspace</a> of global and local retailing and dining with some amusement-park elements thrown in. It is basically a simulated indoor rainforest crossed with a dramatically over-extended airport mall. It boasts the largest indoor waterfall in the world. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg" width="458" height="610.5618131868132" data-attrs="&#x007b;&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:458,&quot;bytes&quot;:4597988,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Indoor waterfall at Jewel-Changi, Singapore&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null&#x007d;" class="sizing-normal" alt="Indoor waterfall at Jewel-Changi, Singapore" title="Indoor waterfall at Jewel-Changi, Singapore" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F936d7697-bcc6-4226-aaf3-bb86c678629c_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I suppose from the air (which is a major actual perspective from which one can look at it), Jewel might look like a literal gemstone, hence the name. But from the inside, it is 60% shopping and dining, 30% spectacle-from-nowhere-and-nowhen, and 10% rather weaksauce experiences (you can cross the bridge in the photograph for a fee). </p><p>In being named for the impressive birds-eye-view spectacle rather than the less impressive worms-eye-view experience, Jewel is a spiritual descendant of Vegas. There too, you go from an on-the-nose outer signification (New York, Paris, Egyptian pyramids, Caesar&#8217;s Palace) to an inner experience that  brusquely sets themes aside to focus on pure amusement. </p><p>Like most Vegas Strip hotels, Jewel is an amusement park in the wrapper of a theme park.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> There is no jewel-themed payoff to be found on the inside, any more than there is a Roman-themed payoff to be found within Caesar&#8217;s Palace. To add a bit more nuance, Jewel has a kinship with the second generation of Vegas experience hotels, such as Aria and the Wynn, which dispense with legible themes altogether, and aim for coherent but nonspecific vibes (processed, theme-like substances) that remind you of being reminded of things, but don&#8217;t actually remind you of anything. Like those hotels, Jewel at Changi embodies an abstract uniqueness with a non-specific provenance. Architects among you will know what to call these things, but to me they seem to combine elements of <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/lessons-sin-city-architecture-ducks-versus-decorated-sheds/">decorated sheds and ducks</a> on a grand scale. In the future, such things will be designed by 3d text-to-CAD prompt engines.</p><p>The metro runs right through Jewel, so you&#8217;re basically not allowed to miss it if you exit the airport. Jewel is a sort of Mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Fun_Time">Super Phun Thyme</a>, which makes it an appropriate symbol for the state of globalization. It feels like a content-free part of an era of globalization that has been overextended way past its design lifespan because a suitable replacement has not yet been found. </p><p>Jewel is a part of Globalism 2.0, Service Pack 3. Globalism 3.0, based on a brave new consciousness, which is what we&#8217;re all waiting for, has been delayed. So the previous major version has been granted yet another life extension. The third if I&#8217;m counting right. It ran out of meaning 20 years ago, but it is still functional enough to keep extending indefinitely, so long as you&#8217;re willing to accept the growing fragility.</p>
