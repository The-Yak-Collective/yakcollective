<p>I would like to declare today Bring Yourself to Work Day.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jJ0Ih668fXJPwPaAFzTHng.jpeg" /></figure><p>It’s actually not a significant holiday or holy day or anything anywhere in the world that I can find! It is the beginning of the Orthodox Church Year, and around the ‘start of term’ in many places, so it feels appropriate :-)</p><p>What do I mean?</p><p>Let’s just make this a day when we can be a bit more honest.</p><p>When someone asks ‘how are you?’, give them a little bit of an answer. An actual answer to the question.</p><p>When you go on a Leadership Development Programme, which tells you to ‘be authentic’ — and then on the first day back, the organisation tells you ‘not like that!!’ — well, point that out.</p><p>When you see the Organisational Values and Behaviours, and your leaders Behaving very differently, ask about it.</p><p>Speaking out loud the thing that everyone is thinking is powerful. You can do it quietly, gently. And don’t expect an instant revolution.</p><p>Don’t be an arsehole about it either (unless that’s your thing). Just ask questions. Have a bit of fun. Bring a bit of Ludic energy to your job.</p><p>Talk about an unusual hobby. Ask a colleague for a friendly coffee — someone who’ll be surprised you asked. Play a small practical joke, if that’s your jam.</p><p>And then see what happens. If you get in trouble, you can blame me ;-)</p><h3>So, what will you do for Bring Yourself to Work Day?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5a33d8bdb067" width="1" height="1" alt="">
