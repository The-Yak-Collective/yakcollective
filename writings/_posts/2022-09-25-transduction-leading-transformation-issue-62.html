<p>So, it looks like I’m switching to fortnightly :-)</p><p>Last week I flew in to London Luton airport, late (the stewardess said, to another passenger ‘oh, 90 minutes is nothing these days’), and missed my ‘wizz bus’ and they didn’t sell tickets on the National Express bus but at the machines inside, and two out of three were broken. The only working one was being used by someone who said he was a refugee from Syria, who already had a train ticket and was at the wrong machine. I tried to help him (and think I did).</p><p>I still can’t shake that all the way through the arrivals hall, there were signed and even a stand welcoming refugees from Ukraine, in English and both their languages — as there should be. But I never saw anything like this for people from Syria, Iraq, or even from Yugoslavia. It really bothers me.</p><p>It has helped my mental health to be outside the UK regularly recently, and I found the first twitter thread linked below particularly useful. I keep repeating a think I heard in a tweet in 2020 — ‘this is the year the US finds out what it’s like to be invaded by the Americans, the the UK finds out what it’s like to be colonised by the English’.</p><p>What hurts is the destruction, the loss, of hard-won progress. I wrote about this in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_why-do-they-say-my-country-doesnt-exist-activity-6800678055540092928-Kzsr.">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antlerboy_why-do-they-say-my-country-doesnt-exist-activity-6800678055540092928-Kzsr.</a> But there is always a next step, always something to ‘build back better’. On Twitter this week, someone said ‘the UK is like one of those football clubs being trashed by their owners. Does this end with the fans having to buy the club back and start again in the Conference League?’ They didn’t mean it positively, but that did make me a bit more cheerful.</p><p>Images this week are mostly from Midjourney — a fascinating thing.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*FYEhv4oXUpbIfiFT" /></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestplunkett/status/1573647218820747266?s=20&amp;t=JhCS9a_6WsFK8IlQjz0Oug&amp;utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"><strong>James Plunkett on Twitter</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestplunkett/status/1573647218820747266?s=20&amp;t=JhCS9a_6WsFK8IlQjz0Oug"><strong>twitter.com</strong></a></p><p>Oof, the doom-scroll is especially doomy today.
