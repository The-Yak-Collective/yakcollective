<p>I’m delivering some serious face-to-face <strong>training</strong> again this week — hasn’t been a regular event for the last three years!</p><p>And engaging with a live room full of people — responding to their <strong>personal development</strong> needs as well as the needs of <strong>management</strong> — well, it’s a thrill!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NXZ4EhDR3NIxrS74" /></figure><p>What strikes me, again and again, is that nobody needs just one thing.</p><p>In this case, the headline training is <strong>agile</strong> <strong>change</strong>. And that’s going down well. But, as always, it’s more important to respond to their context.</p><p>- negotiating room to manoeuvre</p><p>- getting buy-in from more senior people</p><p>- building a support network of peers</p><p>Every time I work with people, I realise that organisations — and people — are so <strong>complex</strong> that what they really need is adaptation to their context. Cutting-edge transformation methods? Probably. Management skills and prioritisation of time? Almost certainly. And… whatever works for them.</p><p>That’s the philosophy behind the RedQuadrant tool shed.</p><p>A small group of people meets with me twice a month and we learn together, bouncing off the core content of our Leading Transformation programme, going wherever we need to go at that time.</p><p>If you’re intrigued, drop me a line — a new cohort will start in about a month. It’s £395/month and some special rates may be available — depending on context.</p><p>More here: <a href="https://bitly.com/RQtoolshedshowandtell">https://bitly.com/RQtoolshedshowandtell</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; What skill do you think is most needed at the moment?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=41dfc6ab1a36" width="1" height="1" alt="">
