I’m delivering some serious face-to-face **training** again this week — hasn’t been a regular event for the last three years!

And engaging with a live room full of people — responding to their **personal development** needs as well as the needs of **management**  — well, it’s a thrill!

What strikes me, again and again, is that nobody needs just one thing.

In this case, the headline training is **agile**  **change**. And that’s going down well. But, as always, it’s more important to respond to their context.

- negotiating room to manoeuvre

- getting buy-in from more senior people

- building a support network of peers

Every time I work with people, I realise that organisations — and people — are so **complex** that what they really need is adaptation to their context. Cutting-edge transformation methods? Probably. Management skills and prioritisation of time? Almost certainly. And… whatever works for them.

That’s the philosophy behind the RedQuadrant tool shed.

A small group of people meets with me twice a month and we learn together, bouncing off the core content of our Leading Transformation programme, going wherever we need to go at that time.

If you’re intrigued, drop me a line — a new cohort will start in about a month. It’s £395/month and some special rates may be available — depending on context.
