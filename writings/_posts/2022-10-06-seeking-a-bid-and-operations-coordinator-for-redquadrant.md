£28–32k, remote, requires two years of public sector bid management experience (or direct equivalent).

This is a coordinating role for someone who likes getting things in order, keeping things in order, and building beautiful structures that last!

If you want to chat about what it involves, you can contact [Antonio Ferraz](https://www.redquadrant.com/)who is currently in a very similar role and shortly leaving us as he progresses his career.
