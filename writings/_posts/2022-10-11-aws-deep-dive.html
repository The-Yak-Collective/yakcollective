<p>Like Lambda proxying, HTTP endpoint proxying requires the use of <em>both</em> a greedy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&#x007b;proxy+&#x007d;</code> path parameter and the virtual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ANY</code> method. Proxying then works exactly as you’d expect, such that</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET https://$AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL/&#x007b;proxy+&#x007d;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>is mapped to</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET https://$HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL/&#x007b;proxy+&#x007d;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The API Gateway can also be used to create controlled integrations with otherwise private systems within a VPC via a network load balancer in the VPC (used to route API calls to specific VPC resources) accessed via a VPCLink connection. Essentially, the network load balancer + VPCLink + API Gateway chain creates a “virtual DMZ” between the internet at large and the internal VPC resources. API calls are made through the VPCLink to specific ports exposed on the network load balancer, where each port represents a particular VPC resource.</p>
<p>Unlike the case with authorization services, when attaching an API Gateway to a VPC all associated services must be in the same AWS account. Note that VPCLink creation is handled via the API Gateway (though the user doing the setup needs to have the permissions necessary to set up - but not necessarily <em>use</em> - the VPCLink), though the network load balancer must be configured separately. Be aware that a VPCLink is a type of VPC endpoint, and a VPC network load balancer can only be associated with a single endpoint at a given time.</p>
<p>One interesting strategy is to use “stage variables” defined in the API Gateway to determine which VPCLink is being connected to (a similar strategy can presumably be used for other API settings). These variables are referred to using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$&#x007b;stageVariables.VARIABLE_NAME&#x007d;</code> notation; their use let’s APIs defined in a given gateway be redefined (in a limited sense) by simply updating these variables. One use case: Swapping a production API to a new backend without having to rebuild the entire API stack defined in the API Gateway.</p>
