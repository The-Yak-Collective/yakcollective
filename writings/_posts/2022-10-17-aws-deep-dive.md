### Working With Binary Media Types for REST APIs (Continued)

While binary media types need to be specified individually, API Gateway does support wildcarding. In particular, `*/*` will match all files, though given the sometimes strange behavior of API Gateway that seems potentially inadvisable; I suspect something like `image/*` may work better (though even here there are potential problems - for example, handling SVGs).

When converting incoming binary data to a base64 encoded string, a mapping template can be provided in order to provide the appropriate surrounding graffiti (normally JSON blob structure). For obvious reasons, a mapping is not necessary (or advisable) when converting a base64 string to a binary stream.

(The API examples AWS provides in the documentation for uploading base64 encoded binary data use `Content-Type: application/json` with a body thatâ€™s a raw - unwrapped! - base64 string. While this makes sense within the context of API Gateway, abusing `Content-Type` in this fashion just seems really bad to me.)
