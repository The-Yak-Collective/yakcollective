### Invoking a REST API in Amazon API Gateway

While testing an API from the API Gateway console actually invokes the API (as would be expected), it does _not_ generate CloudWatch logs (though the API Gateway will helpfully/unhelpfully show you the logs that _would_ have been sent if the request had been invoked normally).

VPC endpoints defined in API Gateway can only access _either_ the applicable public _or_ private APIs - itâ€™s not possible to access _both_ versions of the API through the same endpoint. Despite this limitation, private APIs _can_ be accessed using both public _and_ private DNS names.
