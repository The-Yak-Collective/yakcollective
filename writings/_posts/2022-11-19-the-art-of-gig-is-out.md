If you’ll indulge an interruption of regular programming, I have an announcement to share. My 2-volume collection of essays about independent consulting and life in the gig economy, [The Art of Gig](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+art+of+gig+venkatesh+rao), is finally out!

It is available in paperback and Kindle ebook formats on Amazon.

_The Art of Gig, print and Kindle editions on Amazon_

As you might recall, I was writing a limited-run newsletter with the same name for a couple of years (2019-21) here on Substack, which many of you were subscribed to. These volumes are based on that material. The two volumes contain all the nonfiction essays from that newsletter, carefully edited, updated, sectioned, and sequenced. I have more background and details in [a post on the parent blog of this newsletter, ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2022/11/17/the-art-of-gig-books/) if you’re curious.

Any boosting of the books on social media, sharing on email newsletters and lists, and reviews (on Amazon or elsewhere) highly appreciated. If you do a review, I’d appreciate a link. If you buy the paperbacks, pictures of you with them in interesting places would make my day.

I have a rudimentary book website going at [artofgig.com](https://artofgig.com) and will add review links there. That’s probably the best single link to share since there are two volumes with two formats for each, and I’ll be gradually adding supplementary material and links there.

I just recorded my first interview about these books with [Paul Millerd](https://think-boundless.com/), and that should drop on his [Pathless Path podcast](https://think-boundless.com/podcast/) next week (_The Pathless Path_ is also the title of his excellent book on the same themes as _The Art of Gig_, though it comes at them from a different angle). We had a great conversation, with a particular focus on the relationship between independent consulting and the traditional kind.

I’m looking forward to doing at least a few more podcasts over the next few months, so if you have a relevant one you’d like to have me on, to talk about the gig economy, indie consulting, unusual career paths, the creator economy, the future of work, etc., do get in touch. Offer open while my social energy lasts. I’m also happy to do more traditional live or email interviews on these topics.

I don’t have regular newsletter stuff for you this week. I was going to send out the second part of my [Muskening](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-muskening) series from last week, but events around Twitter moved a bit too fast last night, so I’m going to have do some processing and updating. I’ll probably send that out next week.

In the meantime I hope you’ll check out [The Art of Gig](https://artofgig.com).
