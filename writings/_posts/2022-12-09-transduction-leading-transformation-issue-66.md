Three weeks since my last newsletter — sorry! But now editorially assisted by Amber Griffiths. Please join me in the RedQuadrant toolshed (see below) if you want to learn about applying some of these ideas in organisational transformation :-)

[**Naming the thing is a superpower — when did you last use it?**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/12/07/naming-the-thing-is-a-superpower-when-did-you-last-use-it/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/12/07/naming-the-thing-is-a-superpower-when-did-you-last-use-it/)

The power of a declarative statement is often missed. In business, management, consulting, and faciltation (and I could go on), the person who can identify what is actually happening can help to move the situation forward tremendously. Like ‘the nudist colony in which it is the glances which are veiled’ (ever been in a changing room…

[**Where do you learn best with others?**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/11/30/where-do-you-learn-best-with-others/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/11/30/where-do-you-learn-best-with-others/)   
 This week I spoke at my first face-to-face conference since the start of COVID — StretchCon in Budapest. And what a conference it was!

[**Are you authentic?**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/11/23/are-you-authentic/?utm_campaign=Transduction%20-%20leading%20transformation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ** — ** [**chosen-path.org**](https://chosen-path.org/2022/11/23/are-you-authentic/)   
 Isn’t it interesting how all the important words — like ‘leadership’, ‘culture’, ‘innovation’, ‘management’ — are open to so many different meanings? ‘Authenticity’ is the same. And, like the rest of them, it’s usually a code for ‘I believe you should be this way’. I’m going to do the same, sorry :-) For me, authenticity involves speaking into the world…

 Over the past year the independent Commission on Culture and Local Government, chaired by Baroness Lola Young OBE, has been exploring the vital role local publicly funded culture can play in supporting our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and councils are the biggest public funders of culture, spending over £1 billion a year in England alone. This includes 3,000 libraries, 350 museums, 116 theatres, and numerous castles, amusement parks, monuments, historic buildings and heritage sites.
