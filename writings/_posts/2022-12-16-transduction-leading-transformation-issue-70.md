Hello!

Revue is closing down, sadly! If you’re a subscriber I will be emailing you direct to ask how to transfer your membership. It won’t be as easy to aggregate my sharing of stuff from January 18, 2023, but we will find a way!

This first one is the ‘group of death’:

1) How do we stop ‘doomed to succeed’ ‘death march’ projects?

2) I believe that the future of work is — no jobs.

3) What’s your most controversial view about digital transformation?

4) Sociopaths and scandals: have you ever been taken for a mug? Lied to, manipulated?

Voting closes Saturday 17 December about 8am UK time :-) The winner goes on to play the winner of the ‘wildcard group’…

I am so unutterably sick and tired of trying to get paid for government work :-(

Mostly it is fine — average time to get paid 74 days (was 125 days this time last year), but when it goes wrong — just spent time chasing payments from 2019 and 2020… for the 21st time…

On of the things that I think is really destructive as a public sector supplier is ‘Priority Supplier Programmes’ and the like.

Public sector bodies now want to charge their suppliers for speedy payment and enhanced access to… uh… their finance people :-(

Should be illegal

Of course there is a place for invoice factoring, I guess (always dubious), but when a client writes ‘we expect our primary suppliers to sign up for this’, it becomes a little arm-twisty for my taste. And if it really becomes a requirement then, like social value, it will mostly just be factored into the price!

 Despite our best intentions, scientists sometimes make a very basic mistake: we look for what makes humans unique. Certainly, humans are not just unique, but extraordinary. Nothing else in the known universe has produced art, science, technology, or civilization. But, our history of searching for how, precisely, we came to be exceptional has often led to…
