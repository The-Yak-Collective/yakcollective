_This essay is part of the [Mediocre Computing](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-dawn-of-mediocre-computing) series._

In the opening essay of this series, _[The Dawn of Mediocre Computing](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-dawn-of-mediocre-computing),_ we kicked off our exploration of mediocre computing, my name for a future unified theory of computing that encompasses AI and crypto. I’m going to expand the scope[1](#footnote-1) to include robotics and metaverse technologies[2](#footnote-2) as additional genres within mediocre computing. I have appropriately retconned a few older essays into this series on the home page to reflect this expanded scope.

This scoping is not arbitrary. In this essay, I want to try and get at what I think is the most foundational philosophical connection among these apparently disparate genres: _the active presence of infinite horizons_. All four genres are operationally unbounded along at least one important vector_._ This is not an accident. Mediocre computing is _infinity-aware_ computing that, in a consciously designed and explicit sense, effectively grapples with its own limits.

Mediocrity as an adopted performance standard is the result of rationally self-aware responses to infinities in the operating environment. We humans have always operated by that standard. We’re now teaching our computers how to do so.

As a brief preview (we’ll get into it more through this series):

- Blockchains conceptually produce an indefinitely extended history and are assumed to extend indefinitely into the future.

- Deep learning operates in what I have dubbed [superhistory](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/superhistory-not-superintelligence), and can be understood as an indefinitely accumulating memory operating on an unconstrained input space, while learning and growing indefinitely into the future. 

- And finally robots and metaverses (encompassing both VR and AR and more esoteric formulations) situate computation in ontologically unbounded _contexts;_ realistic descendants of the toy infinite canvases of cellular automata and game-worlds. Contexts where as the computers “move” as a result of computation, the environment can change in arbitrary ways (ie not just via new symbols being input through keyboards).

In each of these cases, I will argue that effective computation proceeds to “continue the game” rather than “win” it. Mediocre computing is computers playing the infinite game.
