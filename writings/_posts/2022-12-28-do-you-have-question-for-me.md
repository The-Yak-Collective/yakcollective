### I have a question for you!  
How, if at all, should I continue with my writing?

**During the lockdown, I started** [**#linkedinhacking**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=linkedinhacking&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7013777449800904704) ** — exploring how to work with the algorithm to share things and get engagement on LinkedIn.**

**I’ve been posting at least weekly ever since, sharing tools, theories, ideas and perspectives.  
It’s been a lot of fun and having to write, and getting feedback, have improved my writing skills.**

**This winter, though — with the doggle needing a looong walk in the mornings and that walk starting later and later as the winter drew in — it has sometimes felt like hard work.**

### So, I’m wondering — what would you like to ask me to respond to? How, if at all, would you like me to continue?
