This post was graciously written by [Podcasts Recapped](https://www.podcastrecap.org/) who is creating thoughtful recaps of some of the most interesting podcasts on the internet. I highly recommend following their site!

#### Who Is David Perell?

David Perell ([@david\_perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell)) is a writer, teacher, and podcaster. David’s online course, [Write of Passage](https://perell.com/write-of-passage-course/), has been taken by more than 500 students from more than 40 countries and from companies like Intel, Google, and Twitter. The five-week course draws on David’s experience writing online, building an audience, and his interviews with more than 100 people on his [North Star Podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/). Each interview explores the methods and principles of successful creators, artists, and entrepreneurs. His podcast guests include astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, author Seth Godin, and economist Tyler Cowen.

## **Podcast Summary**

Paul Millerd and David Perell discuss childhood obsessions, growing as a person, challenging cultural norms, earning a living as an online creator, writing online, the act of creation and much more.

### **Key Takeaways**

- The education system does not reward curiosity. The education system optimizes for obedience and turning things in on time
- We can’t change the fact that we are going to die, but we can transcend it by becoming the hero of our own story
- The ultimate act of rebellion is to care in a world that doesn’t want you to care
- If you don’t have God, everything in your life is a public relations campaign
- With a lack of heroes, the act of creating is the ultimate heroic act
- David told his parents “_I’ve got the worst plan for two years, but the best plan for ten_“
- **One of the biggest secrets of the world – people are disproportionally willing to help young people who are curious, have agency, and are willing to learn**
- The fundamental script of our education system is that you will do well if you become good at doing things you don’t want to do. **Why do we spend so much time doing things we don’t want to do?**
- Successful people are not nearly as busy as people would expect
- We shouldn’t run away from wealth and go back in time, but we need to ask hard questions about the modern world that is so soul-crushing
- Money is only as useful as the things you do with it

### **Challenging Society’s Stories & Scripts**

- David’s internalized scripts for himself were that he was destined for failure, and would grow up with lots of anxiety
- David grew up in Silicon Valley. One morning, his best friend came to school in a limousine. He turned to his father and said “_Dad, are we poor_?”
- This experience created a script of needing money
- As a teenager and young college student, David wasn’t a great student, nor was he dedicated to improving himself. After college, he changed how he viewed himself
- James Clear, the author of _Atomic Habits,_ articulated the [importance of changing one’s perception of themselves](https://www.podcastrecap.org/post/james-clear-on-getting-1-better-daily-the-daily-stoic) in order to become who they want to be
- However, one thing that David had going for him was a desire to learn, and an innate curiosity
- **Unfortunately, the education system does not reward curiosity. The education system optimizes for obedience and turning things in on time.**
- As kids, both David and Paul would get very curious at very niche subjects. Both are highly interested in sports, among other topics
- However, Paul’s curiosities were more “acceptable” because he was a better student at the time
- David’s physics teacher told David that in twenty years of teaching, they never had parents that were more concerned about their child’s future than with David
- Ultimately, David’s parents were supportive of his interests and were very pleasantly surprised with David’s ability to leverage his passions to create his own pathless path

### **Pursuing Knowledge & Personal Growth**

- Paul didn’t start reading until [his senior year of college](https://think-boundless.com/all-the-things-worth-reading-in-2018-175-links/). He was inspired by storytelling that used data
- During the first week of a New York City college summer internship, David had the sudden realization “_This week I realized I know nothing_“.
- David realized his college professors were not helping him to learn. He began to pursue alternative methods to learn (blogs, podcasts, etc.)
- David felt like he was sleepwalking for the first twenty years of his life. Ultimately, he realized that **he had agency over his decisions and outcomes**
- Jocko Willink recently discussed this topic on the [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://www.podcastrecap.org/post/jocko-willink-how-to-become-resilient-forge-identity-lead-others-huberman-lab-podcast-104) “_developing our sense of self is partially the realization that we can have some form of impact on the world”_
- David read [Denial of Death](https://www.amazon.com/Denial-Death-Ernest-Becker/dp/0684832402) and realized he needed to take himself and his life seriously
- “_We can’t change the fact that we are going to die, but we can transcend it by becoming the hero of our own story_“
- The ultimate act of rebellion is to care in a world that doesn’t want you to care

### **Caring in a world that doesn’t want you to care**

- Once you start to care, there is no turning back
- Why are people so afraid to say that they care?
- Religion: Having a God is like having something stable in your life
- If you don’t have God, everything in your life is a public relations campaign
- SBF leaked texts: ESG and morality is all a performance for others

![SBF Leaked Texts](https://i0.wp.com/static.wixstatic.com/media/c87c91_824596e3dd364290a267d8fa90e4f090~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_397,h_337,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/c87c91_824596e3dd364290a267d8fa90e4f090~mv2.png?w=1170&ssl=1)

- In the world of social media, critique of others has increased
- **People who are cynical know the cost of everything and the value of nothing**
- Peter Thiel: there is a decline of heroes
- We used to have heroes to look up to. Our heroes today are people like Elon Musk, who are very polarizing
- It is interesting to note that superhero movies from Marvel and DC have become so popular amid these trends
- **The act of creation is the ultimate heroic act**

### **Write of Passage Helps People Become Citizens Of The Internet**

- Many people start writing to improve their resume for their traditional career path
- Many times, people end of pursuing a pathless path by writing online
- What is happening is that the things that we **_think_** we care about are not the things that we **truly** care about
- Writing is torturous when moving against the instinctual brain, but blissful when moving with it

### **David’s Pathless Path**  **Started With Getting Laid Off and Ended up With Him Telling His Dad, “I have the worst plan for two years, best plan for ten”**

- David previously worked in Sales, where he was laid off
- David’s boss told him “_I need you to stop thinking about Jeff Bezos and start focusing on your job_“
- David cared about the evolving level trends of communications and how to reinvent how we communicate in the digital age
- David sulked the first two weeks after being laid off. But then he found the famous Youtuber Casey Neistat
- David began to make a 4-6 minute YouTube video every single day for 114 days straight
- By day 70, David realized that all the time he spent editing videos he should spend reading so that he could learn more. Ultimately, David realized he wanted to be a writer versus a YouTuber
- David told his parents “_I’ve got the worst plan for two years, but the best plan for ten_“

### **David Aimed High With His Podcast, The North Star**

- David aimed high from the inception of his podcast – hoping to get the best guests
- **One of the biggest secrets of the world – people are disproportionally willing to help young people who are curious, have agency, and are willing to learn**
- If you are young, hungry, curious, and willing to learn people will help you
- Robert Greene in _The Art of Seduction –_ people want to be part of a great story
- Part of the reason that David loved golf was so that he could spend more time with established and successful people – it was a shortcut to wisdom
- Half of success in life is who you know
- David would ask people to go out for coffee or lunch and was told no. But when he invited people onto his podcast, he was successful
- Once he got [Neil DeGrasse Tyson on his podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/neil-degrasse-tyson/), he was able to get other famous guests
- After every interview, ask for an introduction to other people

### **Handling Finances on a Pathless Path**

- Paul did not expect to be so [afraid of money](https://think-boundless.com/how-i-think-about-money-retirement-while-self-employment/) and expenses when he left the corporate world
- David started doing consulting work and had some financial help from his family
- David knew he had a good plan, it would just take some time

### **Building momentum (Speed vs Force)**

- If you have a penny, it needs to go incredibly fast to impact anything
- But if you have something large like a train, it can move slowly and still have a large impact
- Through acceleration and continuous work, David created mass. It takes time to build up momentum
- Paul found it difficult to communicate his progress to his friends and family “_I’m broke, I’m not making money, I can’t prove anything, but I think I’m onto something_“
- Having faith and intuition is so important. Yet, many people don’t lean into their intuition
- **You may be wrong about the details, but correct about the long-term vision**
- From the beginning, Steve Jobs always wanted to remove fans from inside computers so that they would run quietly and look sleek and simplistic
- Early on, these intuitions hurt him. Later on, the sleek view became popular

### **Role Models**

- Seth Godin
- Ryan Holiday has a relentless pursuit of doing the work
- Ryan Holiday’s book, [Discipline is Destiny](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0LM4tMLIsqTIzYPQSTcksTs4syMnMS1XILFZISS0uycyrBADqfQzu&q=discipline+is+destiny&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS984US984&oq=Discipline+is+Destiny&aqs=chrome.1.35i39i355j46i39j0i512l4j0i20i263i512j69i60.1319j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), was a number two bestseller. He immediately got back to work on his new book
- Tyler Cowen is very aligned with his career and interests – he truly cares about what he is doing
- When you start making progress in something you truly care about, further progress becomes effortless and fluid
- [The Cultural Tutor](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is an anonymous Twitter account. It turns out, the owner of the account was working sweeping the floors of Mcdonald’s and as a part-time security guard
- The account has been growing incredibly quickly. David told the owner to continue to work diligently “_The winds of the stream will not always be at your back_“

### **Doing things you are good at**

- The fundamental script of our education system is that you will do well if you become good at doing things you don’t want to do
- The fundamental script of The Pathless Path is that you will do well by pursuing things that interest you
- Why do we spend so much time doing things that we don’t like doing?
- Liking things at different levels:
- This work is easy to me and makes me come alive
- This work brings me meaning and satisfaction
- I am on a quest to make this happen – it is my destiny
- **We must identify the things that truly bring us alive**

### **David’s Priorities**

- Marketing: Podcasting, YouTube Videos, Content Creation, Writing
- By writing, David is expanding the frontier of his company and actively creating new ideas
- Recruiting: Given recent layoffs, this is one of the best times to recruit new people
- David stays extremely close to his direct reports in order to learn and stay close to the daily operations
- With the help of a Chief of Staff, David wants to get very good at communicating with his company
- The point of running a company is to do the things that you care about and delegate the rest

### **Talent Organization Passion (TOP)**

- David looks for competency in all three components: Talent, Organization, and Passion
- Without passion, people get burnt out and leave
- The more narrowly you can define talent and passion, the better off everyone is
- It is surprising that many people get excited about things that they may not care about
- For example, some people get excited about budget and financing. Others might be more interested in marketing and SEO

### **Work of the Future**

- Remote work is a return to intentional communication and culture
- David constantly thinks in 3-5 years in the future
- From there, David has his team break the vision into actionable plans
- Running a company brings lots of imposter syndrome
- Founders are both underrated and overrated
- Many times, successful people are not nearly as busy as people would expect
- Paul is obsessive about protecting his time
- It is impossible to generate ideas while you are constantly busy
- Every morning, David has strict writing time
- David has a profile for his computer that only gives access to writing tools – no notifications. It is essentially a digital typewriter
- People behave how you train them – David wants to be removed from decision making
- Jeff Bezos type 1/type 2 decisions
- The vast majority of decisions are reversible
- David prefers a bias for action

### **Society as a company**

- People are constantly looking for approval
- We are moving to a world that is run by bureaucrats
- Humans go crazy when they don’t feel valued or needed
- Society is inundated with bullshit jobs
- There is something about large companies with all the perks that is entirely soul crushing
- We shouldn’t run away from wealth and go back in time, but we need to ask hard questions about the modern world that is so soul-crushing

### **Thoughts on Money**

- Money is both the most and least real thing
- It is the baseline of how we survive; as well as totally meaningless after a certain point
- The most greedy thing is to make a bunch of money and do nothing with it
- Money is only as useful as the things you do with it
- David doesn’t understand multi-company entrepreneurs. Building more won’t make them happy
- David wants to build one entity that is both the means and the end
- David wants [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) to make a lot of money so that he can invest it back into the company
- In order to make Write of Passage the best it can be, it needs to make money
- Money, if used properly, can create and impact the real world
- Paul didn’t realize that he had shame around money
- The person making 6 figures at a big bank defrauding consumers is seen as a success
- Meanwhile, someone who is working on their own project on the internet is met with skepticism
- After seeing an old overweight corporate executive in New York City, David made the conscious decision to never be that way
- Marvin Bower – if we charge the most, we will have the most and best clients
- Steve Jobs “We can’t just be a great product organization. We have to become a great marketing organization”.
