A bunch of indie RPG designers are doing a challenge called Dungeon23 where they create a new room of a megadungeon every day of 2023. Instead of creating a dungeon, I’m creating locations for a near-future science fiction setting in which I’m planning to write a handful of short stories.

So far I’ve been giving each location a description, an opportunity, a tension, and a character. I’ve already missed some days but I’m not going to be too strict about it. Even a little bit of flash fiction writing is a treat and I think this will be super helpful when it comes to writing the stories.

Here’s one of mine:
