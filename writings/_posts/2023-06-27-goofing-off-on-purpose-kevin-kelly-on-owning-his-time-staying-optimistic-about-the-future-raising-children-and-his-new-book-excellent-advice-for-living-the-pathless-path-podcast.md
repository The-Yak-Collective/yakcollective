## My Favorite Quotes

**On Goofing Off**

> You have to have a good work ethic, but it has to be counterbalanced by a great rest ethic. You have to be able to rest well and um and goof off…I’m firmly in the belief that the value of goofing off and creative waste sometimes we call it um where you are throwing things away. That’s why young people invent most of the new things because they spend 50 hours wasting time playing a video game. You can’t make a good video game unless you spend time playing video games and so this idea of goofing off, taking vacations, playing, and fooling around is essential.

**On How His Son Created His Own Master’s Program**

> And that was my son who went to bilingual schools, they went to a Chinese American School in San Francisco. They went on to a very demanding High School, they went out to college and did everything well and did everything. And so at the end of college, I said um don’t go into a career, don’t get a job, goof off. You haven’t goofed off your entire life right. I mean you’re like your entire life you’ve been striving and trying to get good grades and it’s like you need to spend some time just goofing off, doing nothing. So he decided to give himself his own degree. So he made a course where for a year he made art every day and then wrote a thesis and sent it to his professors, published it and printed it and then awarded himself an MFA. I love that and I said yeah that’s what you want to do.

**On What He Wants To Do Next**

> So, um, I want to become a YouTube Star. YouTube is an accelerant of our culture and that’s where I want to be. It’s vastly more influential on culture in accelerating the speed of learning and disseminating ideas than anything we’ve come before and people don’t really recognize the degree to which it is
