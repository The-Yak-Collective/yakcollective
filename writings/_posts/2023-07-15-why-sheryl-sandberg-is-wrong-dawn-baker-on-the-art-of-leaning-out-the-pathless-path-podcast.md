## **Quotes**

- **Self-Reflection** : [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=0s) – “I am more than just my roles and it allowed me to think back to like what do I really want out of my life.”
- **Career Change** : [06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=360s) – “I realized that I wanted to do something more service-oriented and the other thing was that engineering really pegs you to live in very specific places.”

- **Post-Surgery Struggles** : [23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=1380s) – “I had this identity of being an athlete and here I am I had brain surgery and you would not believe how debilitated it makes you feel like it wasn’t like I had my hip done I mean I had brain surgery but it was so hard to get out of the car it was like I was so weak so you’re just starting from Basics.”
- **Infertility and Career** : [29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=1742s) – “I feel like it’s too late if you say well the critical time is when you’re building a family is to lean in because of the typical age that you are and like the type of career path that you’re on at that time that’s the Assumption she’s making there but she is absolutely not addressing the fact that 13 percent of couples in this country are infertile and worldwide infertility is going up in professions like medicine and probably law but we don’t have data there it’s double it’s at least double that.”

- **Continuous Practice** (Timestamp: 34:03, [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=2043s)): “Absolutely, it’s like a continuous practice. You’re never going to be perfect at this or a lot of different things. It’s applied to medicine too. That’s why I like to explain it as the word practice because people say they practice medicine and they say that specifically because you’re never a master, you’re never perfect at that.”
- **Men Leaning Out** (Timestamp: 37:02, [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHNkB7z_bk&t=2222s)): “I get men coming up to me and they say exactly what you’re saying where they’re like well you know I don’t want to do the traditional thing either but it’s even like less acceptable in certain circles and for the men to be like well I don’t want to achieve and I don’t want to make the most money and be the biggest Breadwinner.”
