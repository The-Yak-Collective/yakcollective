Aida Alston is no stranger to alternatives to the default path. From testing out of high school at 15, to finishing college with no debt, then going to medical school for free in Cuba, Aida has been walking her version of a pathless path for a long time.

But she‚Äôs at a transition point now. She decided not to pursue clinical practice as a physician‚Äîagain turning away from the default path right in front of her. She‚Äôs been a full-time stay-at-home mother since then to her two children, raising them bilingually after becoming bilingual in Spanish herself during her time in Cuba.

She‚Äôs a self-described early AND late bloomer, having sped through milestones early on but now slowly figuring out what‚Äôs next for her work and family. She understands many of the challenges of going off the default path‚Äîlike the paradox of choice‚Äîand how decision-making and prototyping are skills to be learned and practiced while building a pathless path.

She is from San Francisco originally but now lives in New York with her husband and kids.

## **Quotes:**

**Freedom In Childhood:**

> I grew up with a lot of freedom around following whatever we thought was interesting. It was like from the very beginning, like if you want to do this activity, oh now you‚Äôre done with this activity you want to do this other thing, you want to do violin great, you‚Äôre done with that, you want to do gymnastics great, you‚Äôre done with that. We had a lot of freedom.

**On Graduating High Schol Early**

> I was very determined about what classes do I need to take to make sure that I can get out and I can transfer because I don‚Äôt want to kind of extend it in three or four years at city college. I knew I just wanted to be able to graduate so that I could continue to dance.

**The Good Parts of Medicine**

> I loved studying medicine so I loved learning the why, I liked reading the textbooks, I liked learning the physiology. So it was like I liked all that background knowledge around medicine but there were clearly people like my husband who was in the program with me, he was ahead a year ahead of me, but we met down there, he clearly loved medicine. I was like oh yeah I can kind of see the difference, I‚Äôm not quite that one.

**On Ordinary Excellence**

> it‚Äôs okay to not be exceptional. Like there‚Äôs so much exceptionality in being regular like having my family and having the kids and teaching them all of these things and having my family come to visit like the kind of ordinary regular things are things to still be celebrated.‚Äù
