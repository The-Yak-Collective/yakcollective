## Quotes

**Value of Money** :

> People who say money doesn’t make you happy at all or it doesn’t matter like don’t know what it’s like to be poor. When you don’t have money, it makes a big difference when you can pay your rent on time, your mortgage on time, and you can buy your kids shoes to wear at school so they don’t get bullied.

**Scarcity Mindset**

> Growing up for us, I think money was quite important because we grew up kind of like middle to working class… every month we were in an overdraft. I remember doing like a spreadsheet looking at spreadsheet with my dad every month… it kind of created the scarcity mindset.

**Underdog Script** :

> The other one I’d say that was really prominent was this kind of Underdog script of we are immigrants, we are brown people in the UK… you’re not like everyone else, you need to find your own path, prove to everyone how good you are and one day you’ll be able to show everyone.”

**Immigrant Safety Script** :

> The last one is just a very typical immigrant story script which is you know the safety. That’s all my parents ever wanted and righty so… they wanted us to do the typical… get a safe job. In the Pakistani Indian Community, a lot of Asian people will say be a doctor, a lawyer, engineer.
