**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

[https://cherithsimmons.co.uk/corporate/level-7-systems-thinking-practitioner-apprenticeship/](https://cherithsimmons.co.uk/corporate/level-7-systems-thinking-practitioner-apprenticeship/)

“We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation.

In these challenging times, my secret sauce for positivity is embracing resilience and finding joy amid chaos. Amid a world running on empty, a surprising positive shift occurred this August. Some took well-deserved breaks, while others persisted with innovation. Despite exhaustion, we’re not done yet. We’re capable, creative, and resilient — supporting each other and pushing forward brings joy. Personally, a real holiday uplifted my spirits. Click the link to read in more detail.

[We’ve all felt it.](https://chosen-path.org/2023/08/16/weve-all-felt-it/)

Drawing from a thought-provoking post, differentiating terms like wicked problems, messes, VUCA, TUNA, poly-crisis, and meta-crisis is crucial to avoid blurred thinking. These concepts clarify complexity within specific contexts and purposes. Complex situations involve interplay between agents and contexts, making intent, history, and understanding vital. Such distinctions enable tailored problem-solving approaches and foster meaningful sense-making. Click the link to read in more detail.

[Wicked Problems](https://chosen-path.org/2023/08/16/wicked-problems/)

I’ve compiled a list of thought-provoking resources that foster innovation and imagination in response to a social media inquiry. These selections range from “The Little Book of Beyond Budgeting” to “Seeing Like A State” and encompass diverse subjects. Each offers unique insights within specific contexts and encourages a deeper understanding of complexity. Explore this rich collection for inspiration. Click the link to read in more detail.

Designing interagency responses to wicked problems: A viable system model board game

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/…/pii/S037722172300512X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722172300512X?fbclid=IwAR3jhSRGowht5wY8Hr7Qg7eqAYERVriNgMuYsmUVsx0IomBil_yZiWzN2xs)

Abstract:

Government agencies struggle to address wicked problems because they are open-ended, highly interdependent issues that cross agency, stakeholder, jurisdictional, and geopolitical boundaries. While both quantitative modelling and qualitative problem structuring methodologies have been used to support interagency decision making in the past, co-designing an effective interagency organization to collaboratively tackle wicked problems is more challenging. Few approaches have been developed to enable such efforts. This paper explains how the viable system model (VSM) was implemented through a board game, which was employed to co-design an interagency meta-organization that would be capable of more effectively collaborating to jointly address a wicked problem: international organized drug crime and its interface with local gangs in Chicago, USA. The board game was developed to make the VSM easier for the participants to learn, given that the cybernetic language and engineering-influenced diagrams in the original literature can be off-putting to leaders and managers. The board game was used as the final stage of a multi-method, systemic approach, which involved boundary critique and problem structuring as well as deployment of the VSM. The research findings indicate that the VSM board game, used as part of a larger mixed-methods systemic intervention, contributes to building trust in the value of systems thinking amongst the participants, and sets up a rich context for collaboration on multi-agency co-design. The game therefore offers significant promise as part of the co-design of interagency responses to wicked problems because it creates an embodied process for stakeholders to learn about the VSM. It also reduces the work involved in this learning. Thus, the game enables an effective appropriation of the VSM language and criteria.

On Twitter, Pedro Carcamo Petridis said (translated):

> (Almost) sure that these notes are not published anywhere (maybe I’m wrong, but I have not found copies on the web). They are Synco project documents. I’d like to post them somewhere so they’re available. There are 8 short documents

This was spotted by Jaime Alvarez, who flagged it on the Systems Change Finland (

[https://systemschange.fi/](https://systemschange.fi/)

So here we have the eight documents from Pedro, who in an email says (paraphrased):

> Here are the cybersyn project documents that I have. These belonged to my grandfather Lautaro Cárcamo, a Chilean engineer who participated as a consultant on the project and forged a close friendship with Stafford Beer. Among the documents, some in Spanish and some in English, there are texts written by Stafford, as well as others by Lautaro Cárcamo and Humberto Gabella, a partner in my grandfather’s company and also a consultant on the project. I am grateful for their publication, I believe they will be of interest to researchers.

> I am currently going through archives and old documents to see if I can find anything else that might be of interest. I will let you know if I find anything. I personally have also followed cybernetics studies closely (much more on the philosophy and sociology side) so I am very grateful also for the possibility to meet people who have somehow been involved in all this.

I’ve put Pedro in touch with some folks who will find the papers interesting and provide further connections (and see if these really are unpublished — I’ve found that one of these papers was referenced in a Liverpool John Moores University PhD)

[Overthink podcast: Standpoint Epistemology with Briana Toole](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/08/16/overthink-podcast-standpoint-epistemology-with-briana-toole/)

Episode Description

What does it mean to be marginalized? Does marginalization give some people more epistemic authority than others? And, if so, what should we all do with this information? In episode 84 of Overthink, Ellie and David talk about standpoint theory, its complex intellectual history, and its relationship to W. E. B. DuBois’ concept of double consciousness. They welcome an expert on the subject: Dr. Briana Toole, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College. In their conversation, they chat about how standpoint theory makes sense of electoral politics, educational policy, bizarre reality TV, and much more. They also discuss Corrupt the Youth, a philosophy outreach program founded by Dr. Toole that brings philosophy to high schools in the U.S.

[\*How\* many polycrises?](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/08/16/how-many-polycrises/)

In a Facebook post, Phoebe Tickell asked

> Polycrisis / metacrisis is a rediscovery of Wicked Problems (1973) and VUCA (1987). What else are these terms adding?

> Phoebe Tickell [https://www.facebook.com/phoebetickell/posts/pfbid02VRBbiVQPWS7bvbik6Qvjx8xhTa5Vn6ApbZQFuVF7zfAmyfcdbth9UZxypJ6K97Uyl](https://www.facebook.com/phoebetickell/posts/pfbid02VRBbiVQPWS7bvbik6Qvjx8xhTa5Vn6ApbZQFuVF7zfAmyfcdbth9UZxypJ6K97Uyl)

My answer is below

My answer:

These are all just words therefore subject to over-familiarisation, co-option by the existing paradigm and by chancers and the innocent, and general misuse and abuse.

But… it would IMO be perfectly reasonable to say:

– Wicked Problems were a way of defining specific criteria of \*problems\* (and problems in \*planning\*, originally), which involved people, politics, and which from the perspective of planning appeared irresoluble and met a clustered set of criteria, and called for a specific type of approach to them. (Not a million miles from Ackoff’s ‘messes’, of course).

– VUCA relations to \*conditions\* — initially on a battlefield, if I understand correctly, then in the competitive and general environment of a business. It embeds its own specific criteria and is context specific.

(There’s also TUNA from Rafael Ramirez relating specifically to scenario planning and futures — Turbulent, Uncertain, Novel, and Ambiguous — I prefer this to VUCA for a number of reasons)

– Then the ‘poly crisis’ relates to a usually non-specific set of globally interacting crises which do inter-relate in truly complex ways, with the main implication being that it seeps into all contexts and is in a sense inescapable.

There’s some implication in the polycrisis (and explicitly in the problematised ‘meta-crisis’, which I think is potentially an argument for that term being useful and making a meaningful distinction) that it brings in ‘sensemaking’ in terms of our own way of understanding and responding to all the elements of the polycrisis and to them as a whole. There’s a sensible multi-layer point to make that if \*not only\* are we unable to cope with the polycrisis, we’re also unable to orientate ourselves to it in any meaningful way, and our very orientation to the problem becomes a problem. That seems to me to be a meaningful distinction.

– you’ve left out ‘the World Problematique’ [https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803124817999;jsessionid=9367733DD4AF0A3EBCF74C658ABC0522](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803124817999;jsessionid=9367733DD4AF0A3EBCF74C658ABC0522)from the Club of Rome which is a set of (fairly comprehensive) specific interlocking wicked problems which interact to form a polycrisis… though again, it might be reasonable to say that the Club of Rome occasionally veered into a mechanistic worldview or over-simplifying to try to achieve change (hence, for example, removing water cycles from the modelling of the climate crisis, leaving us with the fixation on carbon). So this seems to definitely have been an early version of the ‘polycrisis’ though it was more focused and less implying infinite ramification into all spheres including the social and mental — just total world collapse 🙂

So in my mind if we want to make a useful differentiation, we can go:

- Wicked problems a special class of problem in planning (planning in the broadest sense of making plans, but also specifically in land use and social planning)
- Messes a special class of problem in primarily business-related categories
- VUCA a context in a contested space (battlefield or business)
- TUNA a context we encounter in our attempts to meet with the future
- World Problematique — specific problems (that might be defined as Wicked) interrelating in a way inescapable to our living of our lives (all-encompassing context)
- Poly-crisis — non-specific problems, many of them wicked, interrelating in a way that intimately impacts the living of all our lives
- Meta-crisis — the poly-crisis problematising the way we make sense of the poly-crisis

I could quibble with all of these — e.g. wicked problems do contain elements of sense-making being problematised, at the least from multiple social perspectives — but I do think these are helpful and defensible differentiations. That’s because all these definitions come with some meaningful definition of:

- A \*context\* in which they can be meaningfully defined (planning, business, contested space etc)
- A \*purpose\* or intent which we have which is interlocked with the context (successful planning, winning, etc)

We are too often guilty, IMO, of using these terms and talking in general about the experience of confronting ‘complexity’ etc without explaining the factors which generate complexity, which are all due to interaction and contextualisation agent and context:

Intent, framing, perspective, interpretation, ability, learning, history, understanding etc etc.

(Which in practice usually means we have one context in mind but accidentally or intentionally are not disclosing it to others, because it’s obvious to us).

The problems with leaving these parts out are:

1. We falsely give the impression that the ‘problem’ is inherent in the world (the problem is never inherent in the world), cutting off most of the sense-making potential
2. We prevent people from making the useful distinctions to tailor their approach in different contexts of engagement
3. We allow people to simply describe their understanding of the problem then receive back a version of that purporting to confirm that this is ontologically true

I once had a split with a collaborator because they insisted that, in the era of the climate crisis, \*everything\* just \*was\* a Wicked Problem. I was perfectly happy to concede that that was a valid way of looking and everything you did (in business, the unspoken, assumed context) could and probably should be related to the climate crisis, but that wasn’t enough for them… but in my opinion approaching \*everything\* as a wicked problem (what does that even mean?) would be a huge mistake.

As soon as you ask ‘what does that even mean?’ with regard to ‘\*everything\* is a wicked problem’, you get into the more useful conversation: ‘is brushing your teeth a wicked problem?’ opens up a proper conversation about relationships to contexts etc. But killing off that conversation before it even starts is, to me… a problem.

**The purpose of the event is to stimulate exploration and learning about the breadth and depth of cybernetics in theory and practice**

By **Cybernetics Society and Centre for Info Mgm**

The Cybernetics Conversation 2023

The purpose of the event is to stimulate conversation, exploration and learning about the breadth and depth of cybernetics in theory and practice. This is not a conventional academic ‘conference’ but an event where attendees are encouraged to directly engage with each other and our hosts to explore how cybernetic ideas inform practice and how practice informs cybernetic ideas.

On Monday 23rd October we will be hosted by University College London Hospital and we will be considering challenges of social infrastructure in particular health and social care, education, civil administration, policing and security.

On Tuesday 24th October we will be hosted by ARUP and will be considering matters of fundamental infrastructure (energy, transport, waste, water, information technology)and engineering in particular through cross-cutting themes of Decarbonisation, Resilience and Adaptation, Digital Transitions, AI and other challenges.

We will be joined by guests from the host organizations who will join us in exploring the themes with the aim that they will share their specialist knowledge and we will contribute insights from cybernetics. The essential design for each day will be ‘World Café’ — starting with a provocation from a key speaker, followed by a series of linked discussions with participants able to contribute to each theme and coming back together towards the end of the day to share accumulated findings and, if appropriate, develop actions to be taken forward.

On Wednesday 25th, venue yet to be finalized but also in Central London, we will take more of a look at ourselves and the meta-discipline of cybernetics and picking up threads and themes unsuited to the first two days. Ideas already in train but to which we need to add include building on the great work already in course on our education and professional development as cyberneticians, our new journal, ways of developing the Society itself and hearing about the research work being undertaken by Doctoral and other students. There are at least 6 students working on doctorates rooted in cybernetics across personal health and social care, criminal justice, conflict management and transport systems embracing topics of artificial intelligence, data security, data integrity, domestic abuse and military action and governance.

A detailed programme is in development and will be published as soon as available.
