### We put as much thought into our learning design and delivery as we do into content at the The Public Service Transformation Academy.

We’re trying to help people get better outcomes for citizens and communities, whether they are in management of a new blood testing services for pregnant women, using mainly the private sector — or helping the whole community to get more fit and active.

If you’re in the public sector right now, you have my sympathies — I think it’s wonderful that people are still striving for creativity after the crushing austerity of the last 14 years.

\_\_

That’s why we blend a bunch of things into our offers:

- people who have ‘been there and done that’ to learn from, and with

- work with colleagues in the room, learning from each other and comparing contexts

- action learning support from us and from other participants

- an online Virtual Learning Environment to pull it all together

and, most importantly, putting the ideas into practice as you go — designing and implementing hundred-day plans that help you to put learning into practice — safely — to support your day job.

\_\_

And our eight aspects of commissioning model, developed for the Local Government Association, takes into account:

1 models and tactics — work that actually focuses on what makes a difference on the ground

2 commissioning process — technically excellent, clear, and robust

3 dealing dynamically with policy and compliance

4 generating information, insight, and innovation

5 a user and outcome-centred focus

6 building capacity, capability, and confidence in markets, voluntary and community sector, communities, and people

7 building relationships and organisations across your locality

8 designing a whole system that means people need less help, can better care for themselves, and are in a community and setting that supports them

\_\_\_

We have some exciting courses coming up:

- commissioning sampler sessions

- ten-step introduction to outcomes-based commissioning for police and crime commissioners

- a new round of our popular contract management programme

- and two new National Commissioning Academies

I’d love to hear from you — what’s your best experience of a development programme — and what made it so special?
