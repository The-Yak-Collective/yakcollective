So, you want to transform public services?

Please pick up the dice â€“ and be prepared for a hell of a ride!

Whatâ€™s the equivalent for your  **career**?

Here are some of the thoughts you might experienceâ€¦

â€¢Iâ€™m good at delivery /  **management**  / commissioning my service â€“ but surely I could achieve more?

â€¢Policy is the answer! If we can just get it rightâ€¦ and implement it rightâ€¦

â€¢ **Commissioning**  is the answer. It covers \*everything\*!

â€¢Specify and manage outcomesâ€¦ thatâ€™s all we really needâ€¦

â€¢Ohâ€¦ we need to really get into process â€“ identify what matters to citizens

â€¢Hmmâ€¦ we need to work across all the worlds â€“ everyone has a different perspective!

â€¢Weâ€™re supposedly doing  **digital**  â€“ but we just computerised what we were already doing!

â€¢Ohâ€¦ we need to change management thinking. And influence politiciansâ€¦

â€¢Woah! Now Iâ€™m working across organisationsâ€¦

â€¢I need to do some work on myself! Maybe \*Iâ€™m\* part of the problem?!

â€¢And now it seems Iâ€™m in their world â€“ doing  **systems change**

â€¢I think I might know what the hell Iâ€™m doing â€“ can I teach others?

Here are some of the (very tempting) snakesâ€¦

â€¢Oh these IDIOT bosses and politicians! If only we could do without them!

â€¢Well, that was an inspiring course â€“ but what do I do now?

â€¢Hey â€“ there \*has\* to be a  **technology**  solution to this?

â€¢Ohh â€“ our services are â€˜doing toâ€™ the citizens ![ðŸ˜¦](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f626.png)

â€¢My radicalism and polarisation seems to be counter-productive ![ðŸ˜¦](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f626.png)

â€¢Ohhâ€¦ weâ€™re still doing Bad Help â€“ Doing To people and disempowering them

â€¢Destroyed by the system â€“ this is it, itâ€™s over, Iâ€™m an outcastâ€¦

â€¢So this is what a long, dark teatime of the soul is likeâ€¦

â€¢Ahh â€“ the hubris of â€˜expertiseâ€™

And here are some of the ladders you might find, if youâ€™re lucky

â€¢Deep simplicity â€“ if we can only have honest conversations, clarity, and learning, we can really get somewhereâ€¦

â€¢Good training and development! Yay!

â€¢Hit by the bolt of radicalism!!

â€¢Good help, ABCD principles, human to humanâ€¦

â€¢Deep simplicity â€“ if I just focus on shaping a positive culture, and setting a good and clear intent, Iâ€™ll achieve so much!

â€¢Hmmâ€¦ these people ARE me! I live here, I know themâ€¦ weâ€™re not so differentâ€¦

Whatâ€™s a snake, a radical thought, or a ladder in \*your\* field?
