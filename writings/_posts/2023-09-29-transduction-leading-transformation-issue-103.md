**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### Link Collection:

### My Weekly Blog post:

If I had the opportunity to influence government digital transformation, I’d prioritize citizen outcomes over mere efficiency. I’d promote outcome-focused collaborations, reinstating Public Service Outcome Agreements to drive real change. Investing in digital skills should involve comprehensive training, not just recruiting “rock star” experts. Simultaneously, reforming Civil Service training and incentives is crucial. Empowering digital service experts to streamline core transactional services efficiently is a must. Lastly, significant investment in learning loops would reshape the knowledge management architecture of public services, learning from the aforementioned initiatives. In essence, I’d urge the government to prioritise citizen-centric digital transformation through collaboration, skill-building, and strategic service optimisation. Click on the Link to read more.

[The “Adjacent Possible” – and How It Explains Human Innovation | Stuart Kauffman | TED Talk (2023 – yes, 2023)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/09/24/the-adjacent-possible-and-how-it-explains-human-innovation-stuart-kauffman-ted-talk-2023-yes-2023/)

From the astonishing evolutionary advances of the Cambrian explosion to our present-day computing revolution, the trend of dramatic growth after periods of stability can be explained through the theory of the “adjacent possible,” says theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman. Tracing the arc of human history through the tools and technologies we’ve invented, he explains the impact human ingenuity has had on the planet — and calls for a shift towards more protection for all life on Earth.

[How the Brain Makes You: Collective Intelligence and Computation by Neural Circuits – Balasubramanian (2023) – YouTube, Santa Fe Insitute](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/09/24/how-the-brain-makes-you-collective-intelligence-and-computation-by-neural-circuits-balasubramanian-2023-youtube-santa-fe-insitute/)

[Santa Fe Institute](https://www.youtube.com/@SFIScience)Vijay Balasubramanian University of Pennsylvania, SFI

The human brain consists of a 100 billion neurons connected by a 100 trillion synapses. In its computational function, each neuron is a simple electrical device. In this sense it is no different, in its conceptual essence, from a transistor or a diode in a silicon microchip, converting input signals into ephemeral voltage pulses that transmit to other neurons. And yet, the collective effect of these tiny electrical flutterings creates the intelligent mind, with its astonishing capacity for perception and action, memory and imagination, affection and indifference. In the words of Ramon y Cajal (1854-1932), a founding figure of neuroscience, neurons are “the mysterious butterflies of the soul, whose beating of wings may one day reveal to us the secrets of the mind.” In this talk, Vijay Balasubramanian will explore current ideas about how this transmutation occurs.

I have been hunting a white whale for more than a year.

Nearly exactly one year ago, a tweet went viral for noting Kyiv Metro cut back its headways to a train every 2-3 minutes during peak hours and every 6-7 minutes off-peak due to the Russian invasion. Every 6-7 minutes during rush hours would be an unfathomable dream for U.S. and Canadian passenger rail systems. How was this possible, in Kyiv of all places?

- Mobile eTicket

Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci and other scientists have pointed to “asystemic thinking” — or the inability to think about complex systems and their dynamics — as one of the reasons America experienced costly delays that allowed the COVID virus to spread uncurbed for weeks. Why don’t we see more systems thinking? What are some practical ideas making systems thinking actionable for a greater number of people?

In this session, Linda Booth Sweeney and Somava Saha will explore these questions, and also:

- Surface the forces that inhibit widespread systems thinking
- Discuss practical, research-based ways to lay a foundation for systems thinking in early childhood and beyond
- Celebrate the fusion of cultural wisdom and inclusivity in advancing systems understanding
- Get a sneak peek into Linda’s upcoming children’s book, “Apart, Together” (Bazer & Bray, October 2023)

**About Linda Booth Sweeney**

As an education innovator, author and strategist for healthy socio-ecological systems change, Dr. Linda Booth Sweeney is internationally recognized for her efforts to make systems thinking actionable by a wide range of audiences. In her Systems Leadership Labs, Linda creates experiences for leaders to think differently, and to experiment with language, inner stance, visualization tools and knowledge architecture that better mirrors the complexity they are navigating.

She has made significant contributions to promoting the use of metaphors like the bathtub model to enhance public comprehension of critical issues such as climate change. She is co-author of The Systems Thinking Playbook, The Climate Change Playbook, and numerous other books and journal articles. Linda is currently developing Curious about Connections Conversations (CCC), a research-based facilitation method for use by families, teachers and professionals in a variety of settings. Linda is also an award-winning children’s book author. Her next book, Apart Together, is a gentle introduction to systems thinking for children and will be published by Balzer & Bray in October 2023.

[The BMJ · 4d **Time to ban the word “prevention”** Few phrases are better known than “prevention is better than cure,” and its message seems irrefutable. Prevention is the favoured answer to the accumulating woes of the NHS: if people don’t get sick then the costs of the NHS will stop rising, although nobody asks what will happen to all those hospitals filled with more than a million staff. Despite its universal popularity, I want to ban the word “prevention.” How can I possibly argue that?
