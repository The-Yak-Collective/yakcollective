### What does it all boil down to, for you, in organisations?

I’m interested in the systems thinking | complexity | cybernetics field because I’m always looking for ‘the simplicity on the other side of complexity’.

What’s simple for one person, of course, is complex for another. So there’s no ‘golden bullet’.

But there are some things that are elegant, that can be held easily in the head and generate adaptive, dynamic responses to a lot of different contexts. Surprisingly many of them come down to simple boxes on a page.

For example, ‘ways in to partnership’ gives a nice simple guide to assess whether your joint working has a chance. It’s easy to see which column you’re in, and which you should be in. And, much more than that, if you can spend most time in the middle box, all manner of issues (governance, pooling resources, share of outcomes, clashes of leaders) stand a chance of being resolved. So it’s a simple tool, that potentially enables a lot of progress.
