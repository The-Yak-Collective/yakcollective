**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

In my experience, simplicity often outshines complexity when it comes to problem-solving and decision-making. While there’s no universal solution, certain elegant tools, like the ‘Ways in to Partnership’ concept, can be invaluable. It helps assess collaborative potential effortlessly and offers a clear path forward. The ‘Left Hand Column Exercise’ aids in productive conversations by revealing thoughts and emotions. Other favorites include ‘Three Box Model for Clarity,’ ‘CPORT Task Clarity,’ ‘Four Dynamics for a Robust System,’ and ‘Five Core Practices for Leadership.’ These tools, although diverse, share a common thread of making complex issues more manageable. They form the foundation of my teachings and our RedQuadrant tool shed, offering a lifetime of practical application in just a few minutes of explanation.

[What does it all boil down to, for you, in organisations?](https://chosen-path.org/2023/10/04/what-does-it-all-boil-down-to-for-you-in-organisations/)

In my organizational exploration, I’ve delved into the dynamics of segmentation, blending, empowerment, and harmonization. These concepts, inspired by Barry Oshry and Stafford Beer’s management cybernetics, play a crucial role in human and organizational effectiveness. Segmenting groups people for specialized capabilities, blending fosters knowledge sharing, empowerment unleashes unique talents, and harmonization aligns efforts around a common mission. When one or two of these dynamics dominate, it becomes evident that there are costs involved. By rebalancing associated rituals and practices over time, an organization can enhance its effectiveness. Reflecting on these four dynamics can provide valuable insights into your organization’s functioning.

[Quantum Bayesianism](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/10/11/quantum-bayesianism/)

> _[I must confess I sniggered when I heard this name. It sounds like a deliberately invented rationalism squared joke… also known as QBism (of course). Not sure about the science myself but / and it feels very cybernetic to me… there are ‘many worlds’ they are just the worlds each of us live in. And with a major antecedent turns out to be Frank Ramsey, therefore a link to Wittgenstein, no wonder! Also there’s a claim that ‘the first quantum Bayesian was von Neumann – truly there were only about 30 people in the 1950s.]_

If you require an editable form of the portfolio form please contact: [tony.korycki@systemspractice.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=tony.korycki@systemspractice.org). The CF resource guide that provides references for each item in the portfolio form can be downloaded by [clicking here](https://www.systemspractice.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/SCiO%20CF%20Resources%20v8%20feb2022.pdf). 

**Professional Qualification in Systems Practice**  
To apply for a professional qualification, please download and complete the [Competency Framework (CF) portfolio form](https://www.systemspractice.org/system/files/2021-02/SCiO%20Competency%20Framework%20self-assess%20portfolio%20v6%20Feb2021.pdf), then return it to: [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org) 

The fee for undertaking the assessment is £95. Once qualified, you may be invited by SCiO or SPA to carry out assessments of other members of SCiO applying for a professional qualification. SCiO CF assessment is carried out by [Systems Practitioner Assessment Ltd (SPA)](https://systemspractitionerassessment.org/) for SCiO, and uses a four-step process:

- You begin by reviewing your capabilities as a practitioner against the [CF criteria](https://www.systemspractice.org/system/files/2021-02/SCiO%20Competency%20Framework%20self-assess%20portfolio%20v6%20Feb2021.pdf), using the [CF Resources](https://www.systemspractice.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/SCiO%20CF%20Resources%20v8%20feb2022.pdf) as needed. You can obtain advice about these documents from: [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org,)
- If you would like a practitioner grading awarded, you may submit your CF self-assessment to [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org), and we will contact you within 20 working days, to arrange a CF assessment interview. 
- Self-assessment review and competency grading is supported by an assessment interview with two Systems Thinking practitioners, using a method based on exploration of a number of practice situations, using standard criteria: Situation, Objectives/Goals, Actions, Results and Aftermath/Learning, the [SOARA method](http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/faqcr/competency-04.htm). 
- On completion of this 2-hour assessment interview, we will award you a practitioner grade. 

If you submit your CF for review and grading, this will be based on the following criteria: 

**Practitioner**

- Able to use one or more systems methodologies or methods with support, with at least a skill level of ‘2’ in your primary approach.
- Able to use one or more of the intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methodology or method. 
- May have practiced on systemic issues in only one sector or organisation, and may have only practiced in a part of an organisation that they control or manage. 

**Certified Practitioner**

- Able to use one or more systems methodologies or methods without support, with at least a skill level of ‘3’ in your primary approach.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- May have practiced on systemic issues in only one organisation, and may have only practiced within their own organisation, but will have worked in or on organisations outside their immediate control. 

**Advanced Practitioner**

- Able to use and supervise others in at least three systems methodologies or methods, and can apply systems laws and principles directly to situations.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- Will have practiced on systemic outside of their own organisation. This does not mean being contracted out of a “home” organisation, but must have worked on situations wider than just contained within the home organisation. 

**Fellow**

- Has developed one or more new systems methodologies or methods that others can use, and can apply systems laws and principles directly to situations.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- Will have practiced in multiple sectors, and/or on systemic issues outside of their organisation. Will have worked on multi-organisational problems. 

In addition to the above gradings, SCiO may also award a supplementary title of  **Technical Expert ** in specific fields to applicants who are able to show that they:

- Can supervise others in the use of one or more systems thinking methods or methodologies.
- Can train others in the use of one or more systems thinking methods or methodologies.

Classification at skill levels will support mentoring, continual professional development priorities and support for IfA systems thinking practitioner apprenticeship assessment.

Epistemology (theory of knowledge) addresses several questions which are pertinent to Systems Thinking practice. For example, social epistemology is concerned with epistemic communities of practice, including the formation and crossing of disciplinary boundaries, the development of localised epistemic standards relating to the purpose of the discipline, and the relationship between consensus, dissensus, and political power. Meanwhile, agnotologys… [Read more](https://www.systemspractice.org/resources/epistemology-agnotology-and-systems-thinking-practice)

This presentation offers a new systems theory of value conflict, which suggests the possibility of three different strategies for intervention: supporting people in transcending overly narrow value judgeme… [Read more](https://www.systemspractice.org/resources/moving-beyond-value-conflicts-systems-thinking-action)

[Critical Social Learning Systems: an inquiry, case study and some learning](https://www.systemspractice.org/resources/critical-social-learning-systems-inquiry-case-study-and-some-learning)

Social learning is a set of principles, activities and behaviours, relating to how people collaborate and co-operate to learn in a variety of situations within institutional and organisational structures. This presentation explores its principles and methods, as well as providing an illustration of how it has been applied in a micro-enterprise environment, where individuals or small organisations often interact in informal ways.

[Designing Democracy](https://www.systemspractice.org/resources/designing-democracy-0)

I have yet to find the word ‘cybernetics’ in mainstream writing on government and yet the comparison to steering a ship appears in the writing of Plato 2,500 years ago on government, and the word itself in the writing of Ampere 300 years ago. Beer’s cybernetic approach to systems thinking upon which he based his VSM gives a foundation from which I explore the purpose and structure of democracy.

A revised central dogma for the 21st century: All biology is cognitive information processing

Abstract

Crick’s Central Dogma has been a foundational aspect of 20th century biology, describing an implicit relationship governing the flow of information in biological systems in biomolecular terms. Accumulating scientific discoveries support the need for a revised Central Dogma to buttress evolutionary biology’s still-fledgling migration from a Neodarwinian canon. A reformulated Central Dogma to meet contemporary biology is proposed: all biology is cognitive information processing. Central to this contention is the recognition that life is the self-referential state, instantiated within the cellular form. Self-referential cells act to sustain themselves and to do so, cells must be in consistent harmony with their environment. That consonance is achieved by the continuous assimilation of environmental cues and stresses as information to self-referential observers. All received cellular information must be analyzed to be deployed as cellular problem-solving to maintain homeorhetic equipoise. However, the effective implementation of information is definitively a function of orderly information management. Consequently, effective cellular problem-solving is information processing and management. The epicenter of that cellular information processing is its self-referential internal measurement. All further biological self-organization initiates from this obligate activity. As the internal measurement by cells of information is self-referential by definition, self-reference is biological self-organization, underpinning 21st century Cognition-Based Biology.

> _The article presents a critical reflection on [meta-learning] a remote learning experience in a course for Technical Assistance and Support for Social Housing (ATHIS). The objective of this experience was to promote conditions for students to come in contact with and problematize ‘how’ different concepts related to digital technologies can be appropriated in ATHIS. Based on radical constructivist thinking, the pedagogical framework proposed for the course explored the platforms Zoom and Miro to associate two methodologies for conversation and collaborative ideation – Team Sintegrity (Beer, 1994) and gigamapping (Sevaldson, 2012)._
> 
> _The adaptation and combination of the two methodologies – called here GINGAmapping – enabled the students to get to know each other better and work together in a non-hierarchical and co-creative experience. The results demonstrated that the proposed practice significantly contributed to improving knowledge of the studied topics by each participant and allowed the reverberation of individual contributions throughout the whole team. This experience indicates that Team Sintegrity and gigamapping can be effectively combined to foster simultaneous and integrated work between groups in digital means._

> _About this book_
> 
> _This book describes the neurology of a business as a new dimension of organization and as a basis for success in a complex world. Comparing organizations with living organisms, it places an organization’s neurology (control and communication) as a third dimension beside its anatomy (structure) and physiology (process). Overlooked by classical organizational theory, this third dimension offsets its typical drawbacks._
> 
> _The Neurology of Business introduces Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) and shows how this helps managers to diagnose, discover, and unleash the potential and performance lying dormant in today’s enterprises._
> 
> _The book is based on numerous consulting projects and management seminars conducted in Europe, America, and Asia. It guides the reader through the diagnosis and design process and illustrates application issues with practical examples. In this way, the book provides managers with the language needed to have meaningful conversations about how their organizations are functioning. As such, it will benefit managers in business and nonbusiness organizations, as well as readers interested in general management._

> 
> **_Master complex problems and face radical uncertainty by unleashing the power of small data_** _　_
> 
> _Is your business using data to its optimum potential? In complicated well-structured problem situations, executives rely on Big Data. However, when faced with complexity and uncertainty they are challenged to skillfully handle Small Data. Leading by Weak Signals argues that impending dangers, new business opportunities or innovative ideas may be missed when data are classified as simply not “big enough.”　　_
> 
> _This insightful book with its new approach initiates a radical shift in perspective from running the business to changing the business. While Big Data are very well suited to run a business efficiently, Small Data lay open phenomena which are connected to transforming a company, like inflection points, scale changes, or critical transitions.　_
> 
> _The authors present practical business examples and an 8-step framework to implement their ideas in teams and on the individual level. This offers reflective practitioners a guideline for leveraging the enormous potential of weak signals for effective strategy development and operational execution in times of uncertainty – and gives them the competitive edge they need to succeed._

> _Peter Gomez is Professor Emeritus for Strategy and Organization at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. He was the Rector of his University and President of the Swiss Stock Exchange SIX. He has published widely on Leadership in a Complex World, Systems Thinking in Corporate Practice, and Managing for Public Value._
> 
> _Mark Lambertz is a Digital Native of the first hour since he learned to program with his first Apple computer at the age of 12. In 1995, he founded one of the first digital agencies in Germany and sold it after 20 years. Today he applies his technological and organizational knowledge in an international company as a transformation manager in the mobility sector headquarters of Robert Bosch GmbH. His focus lies on the Viable System Model, which enables a holistic view of organizations’ culture, processes, roles, and value creation._

> _Reviews_
> 
> _“In today’s VUCA world, transforming a company requires observation of ‘weak signals’ to uncover early signs of change or disruption. This insightful book provides readers with practical examples and tools to navigate complexity and stay ahead of the competition, as I have personally witnessed in my own company’s journey.” — _ **_Torsten Leue_** _, CEO of Talanx AG_
> 
> _“Leading by weak signals” would be seen as “the art of leading” if there were not a science behind it. Peter and Mark are excellent at making its principles and tricks useful for practitioners. In a world of increasing complexity, Leading by Weak Signals is not only part of every leader’s toolkit, but also part of their survival kit. — _ **_Martin Pfiffner_** _, author of The Neurology of Business_
