One of the things that gives me great cognitive dissonance and frustration is seeing people – sometimes people I respect – give their title as ‘chairman’.

There’s simply no good reason in 2023 to have a gendered title for a job – especially one considered to be the peak of corporate seniority.

Many people claim that ‘chairman’ is the original, non-gendered meaning, and that ‘chair’ is a neologism. Indeed, some people have refused roles ‘rather than be referred to as an item of furniture’. I, for my part, would refuse to accept a position the title of which was ‘chairman’. 

Actually the use of the word ‘chair’ to indicate a role or person with authority is extremely old.

If you feel that the gendering of a phrase of position or authority or attribution has no impact, may I suggest you consider the attached list of gender fliptropes? These are from the old blog ‘systems thinking for girls’ (which, if I remember rightly, was authored by Charlotte Pell?) – a similar effect is achieved by the wildly popular Twitter and Facebook account @manwhohasitall

I enjoy the old lore of ‘business’ – so my preferred origin myth for the phrases ‘board’ and ‘chair’ is that in the original ‘companies’ (allegedly from con pane – to break bread with others), the meals were served in rich homes – so rich that they could afford a board, from which a table was made from the assembled company sitting on the ground and supporting the board – and a single chair, in which the person given authority was seated. This gives us every right to choose the gender-neutral and perfectly understood word ‘chair’.

An alternative, if nobody is to be offended, might be to avoid reification of the role, and refer simply to the activity – the person who chairs the board, is chairing the meeting etc? 

(Note: we don’t, of course, say the chairman is chairmanning the meeting, from the chairman’s chair).

I’ll give more examples in the notes below.

What relic of outdated language do YOU think holds business back?

Wikipedia has:                                                                                                      

The term _chair_ is sometimes used in lieu of chairman, in response to criticisms that using chairman is [sexist](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSexist).[[11]](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FChairman%23cite_note-11)[[12]](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FChairman%23cite_note-dicrefman-12)[[13]](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FChairman%23cite_note-Zinsser_2007_81-13)[[14]](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FChairman%23cite_note-14) It is commonly used today, and has been used as a substitute for chairman since the middle of the 17th century, with its earliest citation in the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOxford_English_Dictionary) dated 1658-9, only four years after the first citation for chairman.[[15]](https://api.thetopinbox.com/track/v2/link?id=899b418e-389e-4ccb-81e9-de5f0decdbd1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FChairman%23cite_note-15)

Chair! when the authority of the chairman is appealed to, or not duly regarded; to address the chair, support the chair, etc. Now also used as an alternative for ‘chairman’ or ‘chairwoman’, esp. deliberately so as not to imply a particular sex.
