**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

One thing that truly perplexes and frustrates me is witnessing people, including those I admire, still using the title ‘chairman’ in 2023. There is no valid justification for gendered titles in this day and age, particularly for positions of top corporate authority. Some argue that ‘chairman’ is the original, non-gendered term, and that ‘chair’ is a modern invention. However, ‘chair’ has been used to denote authority for centuries, dating back to 1658. I would steadfastly decline a position labeled ‘chairman.’ A more inclusive approach would be to refer to the activity, such as ‘the person who chairs the board’ or ‘is chairing the meeting.’ Gender-neutral language is not just a matter of semantics; it reflects a broader commitment to equality and progress.

[TOMORROW – 2023-10-16 Systems Thinking Ontario, 6:30pm Toronto time – Judith Rosen, Anticipatory Systems, Evolution, and Extinction Cascades (Online)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/10/15/tomorrow-2023-10-16-systems-thinking-ontario-630pm-toronto-time-judith-rosen-anticipatory-systems-evolution-and-extinction-cascades-online/)

October 16 (the third Monday of the month, dodging Thanksgiving) is the 115th meeting for Systems Thinking Ontario.

Anticipatory Systems, Evolution, and Extinction Cascades (Online)

At the announcement of the [August 2023 Systems Thinking Ontario session with Judith Rosen](https://wiki.st-on.org/2023-08-14) in Toronto for an in-person appearance, there were a lot of requests about whether the session would be recorded.  Judith agreed to make that in-person talk less formal, and cover the original content in October in a more structured flow.

To encourage conversation, the session will be run in three parts:  

- Anticipatory Systems
- Evolution
- Extinction Cascades

Participants will have the opportunity to reflect and ask questions after each part.

**Here is the abstract from the original session,**

When we think about evolution — specifically the entailment underlying the process of change in species of living organisms, over eons of time, which we call “evolution” — and as we seek to increase our scientific understanding of it, one glaring omission is that there is no mention of the fact that living organisms manifest patterns of behavior that are radically different from non-living systems. Life does not just react, the way all non-living systems do; life also Anticipates. Therefore, we need to factor in the Anticipatory nature of all life into our models (both our mental models and scientific models) and see where that leads us in our understanding. This peculiar Anticipatory pattern of behavior is, in fact, the “signature” of life. According to Robert Rosen, the Anticipatory pattern is ubiquitous in biological systems, at all scales of organization, and is common to all life forms regardless of species. In higher life forms, such as homo sapiens, it is the very same pattern that characterizes mind as well.

Robert Rosen (1934-1998) developed Anticipatory Systems Theory as part of his work in theoretical biology. He predicted that the Anticipatory pattern of behavior he described will, similarly, be present in extraterrestrial life. It is how we recognize living organisms as being “alive” even if we’ve never seen that species before; how we differentiate living systems from non-living systems (whether we are doing so as scientists or not. But, if we seek to understand the entailment of evolutionary processes, then to leave this out of our models is guaranteed to cause problems. Nowhere is the omission more dangerous than in understanding the entailment of extinction cascades.

As it happens, the Anticipatory nature of life has a dark side. For all the benefits it offers, rapid change in the environment is its Achilles Heel. With human-induced rapid global climate change, we are facing a period of such accelerated change that the only things in the fossil record that bear any resemblance to it are the intermittent cataclysms such as large asteroid strikes — which have caused several mass extinctions throughout Earth’s history. Human activity has now (by 2022) changed the composition of Earth’s atmosphere to such a degree that interactions with solar energy are also changing.

Furthermore, the chemistry of the oceans are measurably changing because of the changes in atmospheric composition — becoming more acidic, for example. Thermodynamic changes are also manifesting themselves because of those initial changes, which impacts weather patterns. Changing weather patterns and oscillation between extremes in weather are driving further changes in ecosystems all over the planet. As the planet warms up, sea levels rise. It would be foolish to think that any of these fundamental changes are going to be without consequences to the biosphere. Extinction cascades are made of this. But why? How?

This talk will describe the fundamentals of Anticipatory Systems Theory, and sketch out how this necessarily must be involved in evolutionary entailment. It will illustrate how rapid change in environments causes difficulties that are peculiar to life, and thereby elucidate the entailment of extinction cascades from an Anticipatory Systems perspective. It is hoped that participants will finish with a much better idea of the need for integration of these ideas into our collective efforts, in science and in government. Intelligent planning for the future requires it.

[Quantum Bayesianism](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/10/11/quantum-bayesianism/)

> _[I must confess I sniggered when I heard this name. It sounds like a deliberately invented rationalism squared joke… also known as QBism (of course). Not sure about the science myself but / and it feels very cybernetic to me… there are ‘many worlds’ they are just the worlds each of us live in. And with a major antecedent turns out to be Frank Ramsey, therefore a link to Wittgenstein, no wonder! Also there’s a claim that ‘the first quantum Bayesian was von Neumann – truly there were only about 30 people in the 1950s.]_

[SCiO Competency Framework & Professional Qualification in systems practice (Systems and Complexity in Organisation – the systems practice professional body)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/10/10/scio-competency-framework-professional-qualification-in-systems-practice-systems-and-complexity-in-organisation-the-systems-practice-professional-body/)

SCiO has created a framework of competencies for members who are practitioners of systems thinking, based on our [Systems Thinking Body of Knowledge (SysBoK)](https://kumu.io/koryckaa/scio-sysbok-v1), the systems laws regularly explored in Development Days, and this is aligned to the Institute for Apprenticeship (IfA) [Systems Thinking Practice L7 accreditation](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/systems-thinking-practitioner/) and their framework of Knowledge, Skills & Behaviours.

This framework details competencies, along with a method for members to self-assess their skill ability, mapping of extent of practice, and evidence, against …

- Systems Knowledge and Skills
- Systems Thinking Knowledge and Skills
- Intervention Skills

The SCiO Competency Framework portfolio form can be downloaded by [clicking here](https://www.systemspractice.org/system/files/2021-02/SCiO%20Competency%20Framework%20self-assess%20portfolio%20v6%20Feb2021.pdf) and is used to commence the self-assessment process. If you require an editable form of the portfolio form please contact: [tony.korycki@systemspractice.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=tony.korycki@systemspractice.org). The CF resource guide that provides references for each item in the portfolio form can be downloaded by [clicking here](https://www.systemspractice.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/SCiO%20CF%20Resources%20v8%20feb2022.pdf). 

**Professional Qualification in Systems Practice**  
To apply for a professional qualification, please download and complete the [Competency Framework (CF) portfolio form](https://www.systemspractice.org/system/files/2021-02/SCiO%20Competency%20Framework%20self-assess%20portfolio%20v6%20Feb2021.pdf), then return it to: [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org) 

The fee for undertaking the assessment is £95. Once qualified, you may be invited by SCiO or SPA to carry out assessments of other members of SCiO applying for a professional qualification. SCiO CF assessment is carried out by [Systems Practitioner Assessment Ltd (SPA)](https://systemspractitionerassessment.org/) for SCiO, and uses a four-step process:

- You begin by reviewing your capabilities as a practitioner against the [CF criteria](https://www.systemspractice.org/system/files/2021-02/SCiO%20Competency%20Framework%20self-assess%20portfolio%20v6%20Feb2021.pdf), using the [CF Resources](https://www.systemspractice.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/SCiO%20CF%20Resources%20v8%20feb2022.pdf) as needed. You can obtain advice about these documents from: [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org,)
- If you would like a practitioner grading awarded, you may submit your CF self-assessment to [contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org](https://mail.google.com/a/redquadrant.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=contact@systemspractitionerassessment.org), and we will contact you within 20 working days, to arrange a CF assessment interview. 
- Self-assessment review and competency grading is supported by an assessment interview with two Systems Thinking practitioners, using a method based on exploration of a number of practice situations, using standard criteria: Situation, Objectives/Goals, Actions, Results and Aftermath/Learning, the [SOARA method](http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/faqcr/competency-04.htm). 
- On completion of this 2-hour assessment interview, we will award you a practitioner grade. 

If you submit your CF for review and grading, this will be based on the following criteria: 

**Practitioner**

- Able to use one or more systems methodologies or methods with support, with at least a skill level of ‘2’ in your primary approach.
- Able to use one or more of the intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methodology or method. 
- May have practiced on systemic issues in only one sector or organisation, and may have only practiced in a part of an organisation that they control or manage. 

**Certified Practitioner**

- Able to use one or more systems methodologies or methods without support, with at least a skill level of ‘3’ in your primary approach.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- May have practiced on systemic issues in only one organisation, and may have only practiced within their own organisation, but will have worked in or on organisations outside their immediate control. 

**Advanced Practitioner**

- Able to use and supervise others in at least three systems methodologies or methods, and can apply systems laws and principles directly to situations.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- Will have practiced on systemic outside of their own organisation. This does not mean being contracted out of a “home” organisation, but must have worked on situations wider than just contained within the home organisation. 

**Fellow**

- Has developed one or more new systems methodologies or methods that others can use, and can apply systems laws and principles directly to situations.
- Can use several intervention approaches that are consistent with and required for their chosen systems methods or methodologies, and has applied a range of options for how to plan, manage and execute an intervention.
- Will have practiced in multiple sectors, and/or on systemic issues outside of their organisation. Will have worked on multi-organisational problems. 

In addition to the above gradings, SCiO may also award a supplementary title of  **Technical Expert ** in specific fields to applicants who are able to show that they:

- Can supervise others in the use of one or more systems thinking methods or methodologies.
- Can train others in the use of one or more systems thinking methods or methodologies.

Classification at skill levels will support mentoring, continual professional development priorities and support for IfA systems thinking practitioner apprenticeship assessment.

A revised central dogma for the 21st century: All biology is cognitive information processing

Abstract

Crick’s Central Dogma has been a foundational aspect of 20th century biology, describing an implicit relationship governing the flow of information in biological systems in biomolecular terms. Accumulating scientific discoveries support the need for a revised Central Dogma to buttress evolutionary biology’s still-fledgling migration from a Neodarwinian canon. A reformulated Central Dogma to meet contemporary biology is proposed: all biology is cognitive information processing. Central to this contention is the recognition that life is the self-referential state, instantiated within the cellular form. Self-referential cells act to sustain themselves and to do so, cells must be in consistent harmony with their environment. That consonance is achieved by the continuous assimilation of environmental cues and stresses as information to self-referential observers. All received cellular information must be analyzed to be deployed as cellular problem-solving to maintain homeorhetic equipoise. However, the effective implementation of information is definitively a function of orderly information management. Consequently, effective cellular problem-solving is information processing and management. The epicenter of that cellular information processing is its self-referential internal measurement. All further biological self-organization initiates from this obligate activity. As the internal measurement by cells of information is self-referential by definition, self-reference is biological self-organization, underpinning 21st century Cognition-Based Biology.
