**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

At the Public Service Transformation Academy, our mission is clear: to empower public service professionals like myself with the transformative power of the right courses. Our goal is to equip individuals with the skills and capabilities necessary for effecting change within their communities and organizations. The Virtual Commissioning Academy is an innovative solution, eliminating the inconvenience of travel. It utilises cutting-edge content and delivery methods such as video-conferencing, webinars, and a virtual learning environment. The program includes anchor days, action learning, and expert speaker webinars to nurture change leadership, system thinking, and inclusivity. By joining the National Commissioning Academies, I will gain the knowledge to drive change, enhance organizational capabilities, and become part of a nationwide network of commissioning professionals. This opportunity is perfect for professionals committed to making a difference, eager to implement the latest strategies, and enthusiastic about collaboration to improve commissioning outcomes. It’s a chance to learn from experts and peers, propelling my career towards success.
