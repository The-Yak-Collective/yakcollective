**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

In the quest for groundbreaking artificial intelligence, I can’t help but notice the neglect of mundane issues. Take my enduring woe with Hotmail’s spam filter—it persistently mislabels wanted emails, a glitch I’ve futilely reported. The problem extends to our business MS365 account, where even internal messages get ensnared. It’s a microcosm of innovation faltering at basics. From perpetually untied shoelaces to USB plugs defying the first two attempts, daily irritations persist. Touchscreens snub gloved hands, printers remain perennial foes, and voice recognition, though advancing, falters in practical scenarios. Despite a world fixated on groundbreaking advancements, these humdrum problems endure, perhaps overshadowed by the allure of grander innovations.

> _Mieke writes:_
> 
> _“At the Relating Systems Thinking & Design symposium RSD12, Carine van Loon and I presented a new concept in systemic design, which we refer to as ‘systemic mirroring’: designing an object that provides system stakeholders with a different perspective on the system they are part of. It confronts them with their beliefs about the system and their role in it. We hope that such mirrors support stakeholders in redesigning the system from the inside out. We illustrate the concept with Carine’s graduation project in which she designed a children’s book that reflects the care system around parents with a child with special needs. You can watch our presentation here”_

> _Constellations Workshops 2023 & 2024  This newsletter brings you an overview of the current meus constellations workshops running in to 2024, facilitated by Ty Francis. All workshops advertised here are ‘in person’ events where Ty will be bringing his unique focus on both the personal development of practitioners with the business development we are entrusted to support and enable for ourselves and our organisational clients.Organisational Trauma & ConstellationsIt seems beyond doubt that an organisational culture can be traumatised as much as an individual. Yet what are the implications of this perspective for leaders, managers, coaches and consultants working within and for organisations? In this 2-day workshop we will explore the topic of Organisational Trauma through inputs on leading edge theory, exploration of case studies, group discussion and enquiry, and – importantly – through the medium of practical, experiential work with Organisational Constellations. For further information and to book your place click below. 2-Days in person in CardiffDates: 19th & 20th Nov 2023 Cost: £580Book your placeMoney ConstellationsThis workshop provides an opportunity to explore the hidden dynamics that might be affecting your relationship with money and financial success. There will be opportunities for personal enquiry into your relationship with money, using family and organisational constellations; as well as teaching inputs and exercises that will enable you to clarify areas of difficulty, entanglement and lack of flow regarding money.  For further information and to book your place click below.1 Day in person in CardiffDate: 12th April 2024 Cost: £220Book your placePersonal ConstellationsNot a teaching seminar, but a 2-day ‘constellations clinic’ for people who want to explore what holds them back at work and in life more generally. Drawing on a unique mix of family and organisational constellations experience, Ty will share his own approach to ‘coaching constellations’ – creating opportunities for shifts of awareness that can be enriching and sometimes even transformational.   For further information and to book your place click below.2 Days in person in CardiffDates: 23rd & 24th May 2024 Cost: £292Book your placeConstellations Learning CircleThis Learning Circle is intended as an annual event to provide experienced constellations practitioners with opportunities to develop their own ‘signature style’ and to improve and deepen their constellations practice in a safe and supportive environment. A focus on your own inner journey as a coach, manager, or other organisational practitioner is a central feature of the programme. Therefore, an openness to exploring your own life-themes (and a commitment to working compassionately with yourself and with others) is a pre-requisite of participation.

He has been practising and teaching Constellations for over 20 years and supervises coaches and consultants drawing on this approach. His Doctorate on Social Psychology focused on facilitating ‘breakthrough’. His practice is deeply informed by Gestalt, Systemic Constellations and the work of Presence taught by The Ridhwan School.

As the youngest TWG in the EES, we have been set up a year ago to help to boost the capacity of the community of evaluation practitioners to support the needed transformation of evaluation practice through more systemic and complexity-sensitive evaluation. Within a year of establishment, our membership has doubled to over 130 members. This rapid growth gives testimony to the growing interest in and relevance of systems- and complexity-informed approaches to evaluation.

The burning questions discussed by the panel are guided by the overall conference theme, exploring what systems approaches DO, or COULD, contribute to this vision, and to change the way we work as evaluators, in practice. These personal ‘burning issues’ in relation to this overarching framing will give rise to reflexive conversations with fellow-panelists.

> We are happy to extend an public invitation to join the international research team of the joint AHRC-DFG funded ‘Enacting Gregory Bateson’s Ecological Aesthetics in Architecture and Design’ research project, for an introduction to the thinking of the ecological anthropologist Gregory Bateson, and a presentation of one of the key research themes of this two year project: The Double Bind of Design.  
>   
> The evening will include an introductory talk by Dr Jon Goodbun on the thinking of the ecological anthropologist Gregory Bateson, whose colourful practice moved from anthropological field work in the 30s, participation in the foundational Macy conferences on cybernetics in the 40s, working as an ethnologist with patients diagnosed as schizophrenics and their therapists at the Palo Alto VA hospital in the 50s, moving on to the study of animal and ecosystemic communication, learning and evolution in Hawaii in the 60s, and culminating in an ultimately unfinished but incredibly rich project to describe the onto-epistemologcial form and structure of both our fundamental socio-ecological existence, and the pathological ‘epistemological errors’ of western thought which – now amplified by capitalism and advanced technology – are unfolding violently through the wider web of life upon which we ultimately depend. He asked, as we must ask too: How can we approach the possibility of future human adaptation to, and care of, this now severely damaged ecological condition, given that so much of our fundamental thinking and practice around design and the possibility of planning is still so badly damaged? It might be that whatever we do, if based upon a narrow western forms of ‘conscious purpose’, will only make things worse?  
>   
> Following the introductory talk, the wider international research team of this project will introduce themselves and some of their particular research questions and projects in relation to this three day workshop on ‘The Double Bind of Design’. The team includes the PIs from the two lead institutions: Sri Lankan academic Dr Dulmini Perera from the architectural history and theory department of Bauhaus University Weimar and Dr Ben Sweeting who runs the Radical Methodologies programme in the School of Architecture, University of Brighton. We are also joined by design theorist and designer Dr Joanna Boehnert, from Bath Spa University, and Professor Simon Sadler, art and architectural historian and Chair of the Department of Design at University of California Davis. Finally from Stuttgart University we have the bio-installation artist-architect Marie Davidova, and the two PhD researchers Stefanie Huthöfer and Claudia Valverdel.

CSS Webinar – Towards Regenerative Ecosystems: Evidence from Action Research on Water and Agricultural Systems

Show in My Time Zone

Abstract Over the past ten years, the Centre for All Interacting Evolving Systems Science (AIESS) has been a focus for transdisciplinary action research and government policy advice on regenerative ecosystems. This seminar will focus on the findings from transdisciplinary action research project on the five natural critical factors of agricultural production (water, soil, genetic stability, diversity, and ecology) which were triangulated with findings of case studies of farmers across India. The research found that the dynamic interactions among the critical factors of agricultural production aligned with nature triggered virtuous cycles of regeneration making the farm rich with water, soil, and highly productive. Biography (Amar KJR Nayak) Biography (Amar KJR Nayak) Over the last two decades, in addition to teaching Research Methodologies, Sustainability and Systems Science, Amar has been involved in numerous ecosystem based transdisciplinary Action Research projects focused on addressing complex problems and facilitating convergence in policy and practice. As the founder and chair of the Centre for All Interacting Evolving Systems Science (AIESS), Amar is interested in the ontology and epistemology of change (degenerative and regenerative) and has been an advisor, consultant, and a trainer to many institutions, including the Indian Government, State Governments, UN Agencies, For Profit as well as Not-for-Profit Organizations and Academic Institutions. At the Xavier Institute of Management, XIM University Bhubaneswar, he has been two-time Chair Professor of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and a tenured Professor of Strategy.

[Tweet thread on the Rabin-Scott theorem by Jonathan Gorard](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/11/05/tweet-thread-on-the-rabin-scott-theorem-by-jonathan-gorard/)

The conclusion? Determinism and non-determinism are not properties of \*systems\* but properties of \*models\*. So it simply doesn’t make sense to ask “Is the universe deterministic?” or “Is quantum mechanics non-deterministic?” or even “Do humans have free will?” (7/8)

Sometimes it’s useful to model these things deterministically, sometimes it’s not. But never forget that these notions of determinism and non-determinism are human concepts that \*we\* have introduced through our choice of models. The universe, fundamentally, doesn’t care. (8/8)

Talk will be recorded for later viewing. Coffee and snacks will be served.

Abstract: This talk will introduce Alan Turing’s work on morphogenesis and an extension by Stephen Smale. In current work, Stephen Smale and I are using a Turing-inspired system to study the dynamics of higher-order structures. I will discuss how this framework can guide construction of a digital twin in biomanufacturing.

The Global Segregation of the Poor

How economic segregation continues to increase despite the obvious potential threats to capital? Further, why is segregation growing in this historical period? And what are the underlying structural conditions that contribute to these rising levels of economic segregation? Using a variety of data, including night-light satellite-based segregation scores, census data from the US and UK, and public opinion data from the Middle East and the US, Amaney Jamal demonstrates that societies that have a racialized cleavage are more likely to be economically segregated. Structurally, legacies of racialization facilitate the processes and infrastructure underlying the economic segregation of both minority and non-minority poor individuals. The author argues that social psychological mechanisms, based on the theory of ‘downward social comparison’, reinforce dominant group advantage over minorities. In racialized settings, these psychological processes help sustain the segregation equilibrium and reduce the probability of collective action against the elite. The author challenges the view that economic segregation is a natural byproduct of growing levels of inequality and forces us to contend with the economic consequences of racialized hierarchies across the globe.

[Frontiers **Cancer—A Pragmatic Switch to Combat Metabolic Syndrome?** Both cancer and metabolic disease have become the prevalent health risks in modern societies worldwide. Cancer is a complex set of illnesses with many definitions. About 15% of cancers are caused by infections, and 10% carry a hereditary burden. The remaining 70%–75% cancers are associated with a variety of processes, often associated with metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammation. This review examines the role of metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation in cancer development. I propose a novel concept of a switch, in which our intelligent body uses its sophisticated set of subsystems and sensors to pragmatically anticipate and combat metabolic dysfunction as its’ most direct and dire threat first, while temporarily accepting cancer as a state that in any other circumstances would be considered detrimental, and utilizing cancer as an additional tool to lower glucose levels. Once metabolic dysfunction has been resolved this switch is reversed, and cancer growth will be impaired.](https://www.frontierspartnerships.org/articles/10.3389/or.2023.10573/full)
