**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

In our lives, we dread rejection akin to fearing death, fearing isolation from the tribe. Ironically, in the modern world, this fear often inflicts more damage than rejection itself. The apprehension of rejection hinders us from seeking, starting, and achieving our desires. Embracing rejection is crucial for personal development and resilience. Rejection Therapy, though not actual therapy, serves as a lighthearted method for self-improvement. By daily seeking rejection in harmless requests, we confront our fear and realize that rejection is a normal part of pursuing goals. This practice, whether lasting 30 days or a hundred, transforms us, fostering boldness, freedom, and happiness.

[We fear rejection like we fear death. It’s the fear of being abandoned by the tribe, left to survive on our own](https://chosen-path.org/2023/11/14/we-fear-rejection-like-we-fear-death-its-the-fear-of-being-abandoned-by-the-tribe-left-to-survive-on-our-own/)

[Launching “Systemic” – A game for applying systems change thinking to policy ](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/11/15/launching-systemic-a-game-for-applying-systems-change-thinking-to-policy/)

Posted by: [vanessalefton](https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/author/vanessalefton/) and [alexfleming](https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/author/alexfleming/), 15 November 2023 – Categories:[Policy Lab](https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/category/policy-lab/)

This blog launches “Systemic” – a game that simulates how policy-making systems function and possible shifts that can be made to improve policy outcomes. Systemic has been inspired by the world of board games, and was co-created by Policy Lab and Matteo Menapace, the co-author of ‘Daybreak’. It forms part of our learning from a project aiming to shift complex systems around multiple disadvantage with the Changing Futures Programme. Serious games are one of Policy Lab’s new experimental methods, set out in the launch of our experimental innovation strategy last year.

> 
> _“At the Relating Systems Thinking & Design symposium RSD12, Carine van Loon and I presented a new concept in systemic design, which we refer to as ‘systemic mirroring’: designing an object that provides system stakeholders with a different perspective on the system they are part of. It confronts them with their beliefs about the system and their role in it. We hope that such mirrors support stakeholders in redesigning the system from the inside out. We illustrate the concept with Carine’s graduation project in which she designed a children’s book that reflects the care system around parents with a child with special needs.

> _Constellations Workshops 2023 & 2024  This newsletter brings you an overview of the current meus constellations workshops running in to 2024, facilitated by Ty Francis. All workshops advertised here are ‘in person’ events where Ty will be bringing his unique focus on both the personal development of practitioners with the business development we are entrusted to support and enable for ourselves and our organisational clients.Organisational Trauma & ConstellationsIt seems beyond doubt that an organisational culture can be traumatised as much as an individual. Yet what are the implications of this perspective for leaders, managers, coaches and consultants working within and for organisations? In this 2-day workshop we will explore the topic of Organisational Trauma through inputs on leading edge theory, exploration of case studies, group discussion and enquiry, and – importantly – through the medium of practical, experiential work with Organisational Constellations. For further information and to book your place click below. 2-Days in person in CardiffDates: 19th & 20th Nov 2023 Cost: £580Book your placeMoney ConstellationsThis workshop provides an opportunity to explore the hidden dynamics that might be affecting your relationship with money and financial success. There will be opportunities for personal enquiry into your relationship with money, using family and organisational constellations; as well as teaching inputs and exercises that will enable you to clarify areas of difficulty, entanglement and lack of flow regarding money.  For further information and to book your place click below.1 Day in person in CardiffDate: 12th April 2024 Cost: £220Book your placePersonal ConstellationsNot a teaching seminar, but a 2-day ‘constellations clinic’ for people who want to explore what holds them back at work and in life more generally. Drawing on a unique mix of family and organisational constellations experience, Ty will share his own approach to ‘coaching constellations’ – creating opportunities for shifts of awareness that can be enriching and sometimes even transformational.   For further information and to book your place click below.2 Days in person in CardiffDates: 23rd & 24th May 2024 Cost: £292Book your placeConstellations Learning CircleThis Learning Circle is intended as an annual event to provide experienced constellations practitioners with opportunities to develop their own ‘signature style’ and to improve and deepen their constellations practice in a safe and supportive environment. A focus on your own inner journey as a coach, manager, or other organisational practitioner is a central feature of the programme. Therefore, an openness to exploring your own life-themes (and a commitment to working compassionately with yourself and with others) is a pre-requisite of participation.
