**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

In today’s challenging landscape, where the pandemic, war, and climate crisis impact us, prioritizing people is pivotal for organizational success. Reflecting on the Operational Excellence Summit, the consistent theme emerged – It’s All About The People. The five core leadership practices offer proven and impactful ways to foster organizational development. From honest conversations to clarity, learning, culture shaping, and clear intent practices, they empower leaders to navigate the complexities of the mid-2020s. Recognizing the significance of how we treat and listen to our people, these practices pave the way for success in the dynamic environment we face.

[The joke often goes that managers pick up the hashtag#OperationalExcellence bible and flip through the chapters: hmmm ‘Create Flow’? Sounds confusing… what else we got? ‘Pull at the rate of demand’?

Facilitation is a nuanced art that can transform dynamics in meetings. I’ve experienced skeptics embracing the ‘helicopter view’ concept and witnessed bitter adversaries finding common ground through skilled facilitation. In teaching facilitation as part of the Level 7 Systems Thinking Apprenticeship, I emphasize the need to distinguish between ‘naïve facilitation’ and ‘deep facilitation.’ To aid this, I’ve crafted a facilitation canvas focusing on planning (identifying key contributors, preparing, considering inputs, and shaping the environment), vibes (addressing pitfalls, challenging assumptions, clarifying intent, and creating a conducive container), and process (visualizing outcomes, defining outputs, planning the agenda, and incorporating reflection). It’s a flexible tool for thoughtful and effective facilitation.

[Are you planning a workshop, meeting, or event that needs effective facilitation? If so, you might want to check out this handy tool that I use to prepare, design, and deliver engaging and productive sessions. It’s called the facilitation canvas, and it helps you think through three key aspects of facilitation: planning, vibes, and process.](https://chosen-path.org/2023/11/28/are-you-planning-a-workshop-meeting-or-event-that-needs-effective-facilitation-if-so-you-might-want-to-check-out-this-handy-tool-that-i-use-to-prepare-design-and-deliver-engaging-and-productive/)

Perhaps a fitting tribute to Lucy Loh, who tragically passed away in October, as per Patrick Hoverstadt’s obituary post just shared.

The paper is not yet available outside the paywall, but looks to be another seminal bit of work she was instrumental in creating.

[RIP Lucy Loh, a systems thinker who exemplified the best of the field, made many significant contributions, and was almost universally admired, respect and liked](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/12/01/rip-lucy-loh-a-systems-thinker-who-exemplified-the-best-of-the-field-made-many-significant-contributions-and-was-almost-universally-admired-respect-and-liked/)

[I was lucky enough to know Lucy, and marginally work with her through her partnership with Patrick Hoverstadt and involvement with SCiO. My comments, though, probably belong in their existing place as responses to this LinkedIn post from her long-time business partner (and great friend) Patrick Hoverstadt. I think this serves as an excellent obituary, including all the comments, responses, and reshares. If you wish to add your comments, I suggest you respond there].

Patrick Hoverstadt:

> _Sad to have to share that my long term business partner Lucy Loh died last week. I worked with Lucy for around 11 years, she wasn’t just very, very smart, creative – making substantial advances in several fields she worked in, she was kind, thoughtful, immensely hard working and professional, but she was also great fun to work with as several clients and colleagues have attested. Sadly, Lucy also had appalling luck health-wise with a series of accidents and spinal problems that left her in permanent pain and in a wheelchair for the last 5 years. Her overriding characteristic was I think the courage with which she faced her challenges and still managed to work both harder and smarter than pretty much anyone else I know. She will be greatly missed by family, friends, colleagues and clients. It was a privilege to know her for as long as I did._

Het Viable Systems Model (VSM) biedt een raamwerk voor het ontwikkelen van flexibele en aanpasbare organisaties. Alhoewel het in de jaren zeventig en tachtig van de twintigste eeuw is ontwikkeld door Stafford Beer, en intussen internationaal veelvuldig gebruikt wordt als hulpmiddel voor het begrijpen en herontwerpen van organisaties, is het in België weinig bekend. Als SCiO-België besloten we daarom om in het werkingsjaar 2021-22 en in het werkingsjaar 2022-23 er Deep Dive sessies aan te besteden.

The systemic toolkit is comprehensive. A causal loop diagram occupies a special place among them. Indeed, it helps to name the specific dynamics in contexts by exploring the dynamic properties associated with our concepts and critically questioning the positive and negative feedback mechanisms. In spring 2023, a working group led by Miguel Pantalon set about applying causal loop diagramming to the broad domain of circular economy, and more specifically the food system. This led to surprising insights that had hitherto remained beyond the scope of policymakers. But at the same time, it was an … [Read more](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systemspractice.org%2Fevents%2Fopen-lezing-miguel-pantalon-toolkit-power-meta-causal-loop-diagrams-applied-circular-economy&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ca21f8da60565491d668108dbf1cd6995%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638369636795647313%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Rg9S4jrDpkudamNN%2BZBYuM1KNPYc2yz4y5pMpKFKSN4%3D&reserved=0)

SCiO has opened up Cohort 3 (Apprentice Edition) of the Enhanced Learning Club. Here, we have created a safe and accessible space where apprentices can come together to explore systems ideas, concepts and approaches and, together, enhance our understanding and confidence. Others studying Systems Thinking are also welcome.

This is the place to ask the ‘silly’ questions, to discuss your difficulties, to share your ideas and interpretations whilst helping others do the same. In the ELC, there are no novices, and no experts.

If you’re interested in joining cohort 3 with fellow apprentices, please [enquire here](mailto:Gavin.Roberts@Systemspractice.org).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Individual modules of  **professional development courses**  from the apprenticeship can be booked by anyone at commercial rates – [see details here ](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systemspractice.org%2Fevents%2Fprofessional-development&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ca21f8da60565491d668108dbf1cd6995%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638369636795491065%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ERUCgSAm0e0O0smWuaiLAd%2BrjpPPkVIK9oZ4XWVIX8Q%3D&reserved=0).

Message from Otto:

A New Concept of Advanced Systems Thinking

Highlights

- Focused on the mental processes of the systems thinker, the books introduce a paradigm shift in advanced systems thinking: rather than fixating attention on systems hypostatized by the thinker on purely logical grounds, the books lay bare the thought-form structure of the thinker’s real-time movements-in-thought that led him to hypostatize the system in question, thus making visible the ‘absences’ in the thinker’s thought that need to be repaired.
- By centering on the systems thinker’s own mental process and its cognitive-  
developmental structure, the books outline an assessment methodology for judging the quality of individual system thinkers’ process in terms of the complexity and maturity of  
their thinking.
- Thereby, they deliver the foundation for empirical studies in systems thinking as a part of studies in adult cognitive development; the books also lay the foundation for teaching advanced systems thinking in a self-reflective manner, not primarily for “solving problems” (which are always a function of the thinker’s thought maturity), but for measuring and boosting the thought complexity a thinker is presently capable of.
- The books thus amount to an epistemology of advanced systems thinking that highlights the latter’s limitations when it is conducted in purely logical terms, simultaneously showing that logical thinking, (in Western cultures) mature at 25 years of age, naturally evolves into dialectical thinking over the lifespan.
- The books are based on Laske’s Dialectical Thought Form Framework (DTF, put in place in 2000), which is continued to be taught in international cohorts at the  
Interdevelopmental Institute ([https://interdevelopmentals.org/services/](https://interdevelopmentals.org/services/)). Three New Books on Advanced Systems Thinking by Otto Laske, known as Inventor of New Thinking Tools, have appeared at Springer

Volume 1: Approaching Real-World Complexity with Dialectical Thinking (ISBN 978-3-031-40331-6)  
Volume 2: How to Measure and Boost Thought Maturity (ISBN 978-30031-40984-4)  
Volume 3: Manual of Dialectical Thought Forms (ISBN 978-3-031-40338-5)

- The books spell out and interpret validated empirical outcomes of adult-developmental research in cognitive development over the life span, — a discipline now 25 years old but curiously kept out of the systems thinking mainstream which therefore lacks a reflexive meta-level.
- The books articulate the pedagogical foundations of 20 years of undergraduate and graduate instruction in advanced systems thinking at the Interdevelopmental Institute (IDM; [http://www.interdevelopmentals.org](http://www.interdevelopmentals.org)), delivered in international cohorts in English, French, German, and Spanish.
- From a historical perspective, the books fuse insights of the Frankfurt School and the Harvard Kohlberg School as well as integrate cutting-edge insights deriving from R.Bhaskar’s and M. Archer’s Dialectical Critical Realism.  
Having proven their worth in practice, they are ready to be used for teaching and examinations at colleges, universities, think tanks, and in programs of executive and team development. I would be happy to mentor your staff in the novel subject of the three books.  
Sincerely,  
Otto Laske, Founder and Director, Interdevelopmental Institute (IDM)
