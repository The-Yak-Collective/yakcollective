**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### My Weekly Blog post:

This holiday season, I reflect on the power of reframing, inspired by a dad’s gingerbread mishap and a lab’s mislabeling crisis. Drawing from House MD’s diagnostic prowess, I embrace reframing in leadership, innovation, and problem-solving. Precision matters, as does perspective. Subjective experiences can be objectified, fostering curiosity and humility. As a consultant, I employ reframing tools to guide clients. Amid challenges, I invite you to reframe, unlocking unforeseen possibilities. In the spirit of a challenging year, let’s approach life with openness and a fresh outlook—whether managing public service or baking gingerbread. Wishing all a joyous holiday season of reflection and discovery.

[Open Systems Theory](https://stream.syscoi.com/2023/12/20/open-systems-theory/)

Welcome to the OST website where we introduce the powerful social science body of knowledge known as Open Systems Theory (OST).  OST is a set of knowledge and tools that organisations can use to change how they work.  OST is used to improve employee engagement and business outcomes.  It is backed by 50 years of research and real-world application. 

OST is built on these pillars

- [Body of knowledge](https://opensystemstheory.org/sample-page/key-concepts/)
- [Tools for application](https://opensystemstheory.org/sample-page/tools-of-ost/)
- [Real world implementation](https://opensystemstheory.org/contact/)

This is site has been created by a collective of agile and Organisational Change practitioners who have grown tired of frameworks and top-down work structures.  We believe that OST can change the experience of working in an organisation.  It acknowledges the need for a hierarchy of function whilst creating organisational designs where people who do the work are supported and empowered to manage and deliver.  Action research shows significant improvements in business outcomes.

Explore our website to learn more about how OST can help you and your organisation navigate the challenges of our rapidly changing world.  If you would like to know more [contact us here](https://opensystemstheory.org/contact/).

On January 2023, our journey took us to Canberra for an exciting and pivotal meeting with Dr. Merrelyn Emery. This was our first face-to-face interaction with her, a crucial step in preparation for the six-day Open Systems Theory (OST) training we had organised for April that year. Our venue, a pub handpicked by Merrelyn herself, couldn’t have been more quintessentially Australian. Throughout our interview, we were captivated by Merrelyn’s remarkable blend of wit, humility, and wisdom. Her passion for fostering democratic institutions was not just inspiring but deeply infectious. It’s our sincere hope that you’ll find the interview as enlightening and enjoyable as we did.
