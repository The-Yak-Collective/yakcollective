What’s the collective noun for _protocol?_ I think a partial answer is what programmers call a _dev environment_ (dev is short for development)_._ A collection of protocols is a dev environment. In theory, a harmonious assemblage of near-unconscious codified strata of behaviors that serves as a coherent context for effective accumulating conscious action at multiple levels of abstraction.

Every working dev environment is a collection of protocols, but not every collection of protocols adds up to a dev environment. The ones that aren’t either don’t add up in any meaningful way, or add up to a clusterfuck.

This time last year, I semi-jokingly set myself an actual resolution for 2023: Setting up the dev environment for my life. I regret to report that I have mostly failed to achieve this resolution, and my trajectory through the year has mostly resembled the dramatic arc of the meme comic below that inspired it.

While I didn’t create a clusterfuck, the collection of working/failing protocols that is my life, plus all the random disorganized actions (accounting for the majority of my behaviors frankly) never quite rose to the level of a coherent dev environment.

But reflecting on my failure got me thinking: Is _this_ what’s wrong with the planet? A failure to set up a planetary dev-environment? Is the planet failing in the same ways I am?
