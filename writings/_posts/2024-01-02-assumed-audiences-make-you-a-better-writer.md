> Naming your invisible audiences [frees you] from unspoken obligations

She does this by prefacing her posts:

> At the beginning of many of my posts, I have a small informational box that tells you my **assumed audience** – who I think I’m writing this piece for.

I like the idea of stating an assumed audience at the top of a blog post. I’ve tried it on a few posts so far and I’ve found it a helpful north star while writing.

There are a million different ways to write about a topic. In my first drafts on topics, I sometimes get lost in all the different facets I _could_ cover. Writing an “assumed audience” call-out helps ground me in what angle I care about most and gives me explicit permission to ignore everything else.

While I can’t say for sure if it benefits readers, I can point to “[🌳 how I publish my Zettelkasten](/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html)” as evidence that it might.

[🌳 how I publish my Zettelkasten](/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html) is the most-viewed post on my blog by a wide-margin[1](#fn:1). And it’s not for Zettelkasten newbies. When I first wrote that piece, my outline included the typical beginner topics around “What is a Zettelkasten” and “Why might you want one”. As a newbie myself, there was nothing new I could add to those topics. Furthermore, most of the article would be about the nuts and bolts of setting up an Obsidian-to-Github-Pages publishing pipeline. Anyone interested in “What is a Zettelkasten” are not looking to _publish_ one of their own and vice versa. Anyone excited about what I _really_ had to say are well-acquainted with [Beatrice Webb](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2374/zettelkasten-method-state-of-the-art-in-1898).

Writing the “Assumed Audience” box for that piece gave me permission to dive into level 2 on the topic without worrying about providing an on-ramp. That enabled me to write a more focused piece. I dove into topics like regexes and special scripts, and that paid off for the audience.

So if your blog doesn’t already have a built-in audience profile, I recommend giving the “assumed audience” call-out a try! It’s helped me maintain focus piece-by-piece. And maybe it’ll help you too!
