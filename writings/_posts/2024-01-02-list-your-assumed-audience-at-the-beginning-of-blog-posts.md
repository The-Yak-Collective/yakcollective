Maggie Appleton [writes](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience):

> Naming your invisible audiences [frees you] from unspoken obligations

She does this by prefacing her posts:

> At the beginning of many of my posts, I have a small informational box that tells you my **assumed audience** ‚Äì who I think I‚Äôm writing this piece for.

I liked the idea of stating an assumed audience at the top of a blog post. The idea that many articles online these days either go too deep or not deep enough (and more often not deep enough) in part because they want to get the max number of clicks, and not because they have a well-defined audience.
