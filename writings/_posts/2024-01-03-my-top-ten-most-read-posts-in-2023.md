I thought this would be an interesting run-through. Notable that many of these were not written in 2023!

**Three in joint tenth place**

- [There are ‘only’ seven ways to make savings and improvements in service organisations](https://chosen-path.org/2021/01/14/there-are-only-seven-ways-to-make-savings-and-improvements-in-service-organisations/) – from January 2021, a nice overview of one of my actual ‘own inventions’, our seven ways to save and improve model
- [Are we here to fight alligators, or drain the swamp?](https://chosen-path.org/2021/10/27/are-we-here-to-fight-alligators-or-drain-the-swamp/) Getting ‘upstream’ in service organisations, creating more transformational opportunities (late 2021)
- [RIP Ryuichi Samakoto](https://chosen-path.org/2023/04/02/rip-ryuichi-sakamoto/)

**Ninth place**

- [Are you a cat person or a dog person?](https://chosen-path.org/2022/07/27/are-you-a-cat-person-or-a-dog-person/) A silly reflection on how people present in organisational life.

**Eighth place**

- [Stochastic parrots will keep us trapped in our own mediocrity](https://chosen-path.org/2023/03/04/stochastic-parrots-will-keep-us-trapped-in-our-own-mediocrity/) – AI will, of course, eat itself. Wrapped up in a complaint about LinkedIn’s AI generated articles.

**Seventh place**

- [CPORT task definition](https://chosen-path.org/2021/07/27/cport-task-definition/) – inspired by the tradition of Elliott Jacques, generating clarity in task assignment

**Sixth place**

- [Complexity is not a paradigm shift](https://chosen-path.org/2021/05/20/complexity-is-not-a-paradigm-shift/) – it’s an experience of the world, from 2021

**Fifth place**

- [Transformation is a load of old b\*ll\*cks, isn’t it?](https://chosen-path.org/2021/11/10/transformation-is-a-load-of-old-bllcks-isnt-it/) Nothing like undercutting yourself, is there? 2021 again…

**Fourth place**

- [An outline approach to organisation or service review](https://chosen-path.org/2021/12/08/an-outline-approach-to-organisation-or-service-review/) – guess which year this is from?

T **hird place**

- [My favourite Peter Block quotes](https://chosen-path.org/2021/02/15/my-favourite-peter-block-quotes/) – give good guru. Feb 2021

**Second place**

- [What kind of leader are you?](https://chosen-path.org/2023/04/19/what-kind-of-a-leader-are-you/) Linkedin to my podcast interview on Rick Torseth’s Swamp Leadership – the problems with consulting, and with Adaptive Leadership. 2023!!

**First place**

- [The Double Diamond as an example of some challenges of attribution in the history of ideas](https://chosen-path.org/2021/05/05/the-double-diamond-as-an-example-of-some-challenges-of-attribution-in-the-history-of-ideas/)– a messy, multi-edited but ultimately useful and, I think, good-hearted look at attribution in our line of work.

Fascinating how very different these are from [my top posts on LinkedIn this year](https://chosen-path.org/2023/12/26/i-am-once-again-asking-how-if-at-all-should-i-continue-to-write-on-linkedin/)!
