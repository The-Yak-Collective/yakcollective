Today at the grocery store a man said[1](#fn:1) to me:

- “They say the economy is getting better but everything is still so expensive! I don’t know what the White House is seeing. They must have someone else shopping for them.”
- “I’m helping get groceries for my dad but I don’t have the money. I should ask him to pay me back but I feel bad– he’s my dad! He’s old. I want to help him out.”

As a wound heals, it forms a scab. An itchy, painful scab is still a problem. It may not be at risk of infection, but it’s still a wound that hasn’t fully healed. Maybe it hurts every time you move. Maybe it restricts your movement.

When journalists say “By the numbers, the economy is doing well, but people don’t _feel_ like it.” They need to tack on one more sentence to clarify why. It’s not a mystery, it’s a scab.

1. The wording on these are not exact, but these are the exact sentiments expressed over the course of our brief milk-aisle conversation. [↩](#fnref:1)
