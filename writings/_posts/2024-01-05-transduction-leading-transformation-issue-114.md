**Systems Thinking Apprenticeship (2023)**

We are delighted to share the news that there is now a Level 7 Systems Thinking Practitioner Apprenticeship available in England.

Systems thinking practice was developed specifically to address highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic situations. It helps you to model each situation as a system incorporating many different parts, dependencies and relationships. Systems thinking practitioners are uniquely equipped for achieving large-scale transformational change.

If you live in England, you can benefit from the scheme. The Apprenticeship is a two-and-a-half year, day release, post-graduate qualification with government funding of up to £18,000 per person. It is fully supported by expert tutors, comprehensive learning materials, and ongoing action learning.

This is a practice-based, portfolio assessed programme which draws on core systems approaches and practice skills. You’ll be supported in your job to actually put the learning to work right away, and you will be evaluated on how you incorporate your continual learning into your practice.

It’s been designed by practitioners for practitioners — the people who have not just read the books, but have written them. More importantly, these are people who have been there, done it, know about all (or at least most) of the pitfalls, and can guide you away from them.

The professional body for systems practice, SCiO, is providing world-class systems practitioner-tutors, and is supporting the curriculum development and overall approach of the programme. They are acting in collaboration with Cherith Simmons Learning and Development, who provide the apprenticeship. Further details are available here.

If you’re not in England, you can still sign up to individual modules here.

And if you are interested in developing your transformation skills, take a look at the RedQuadrant tool shed. This is a small group action learning journey with Benjamin Taylor, founder of the consultancy RedQuadrant, supported by 24 online modules covering all aspects of organisational transformation. Get a 20% discount by mentioning Enlightened Enterprise Academy.

### Link Collection:

### My Weekly Blog post:

Over the past year, my posts have accumulated a million views and 10,000 engagements, a pleasing vanity metric but also a responsibility, considering the time taken from readers. Despite not adhering strictly to algorithmic rules and covering a broad spectrum of topics, I don’t funnel engagements for profit or sell anything overtly. Reflecting on my four-year writing journey, I admit it’s not always effortless, yet my diverse and thought-provoking posts make me reasonably proud. Seeking feedback for future writing endeavors, I present my top posts of 2023, addressing Adaptive Leadership, Operational Excellence, team dynamics, tax system issues, and reflections on Large Language Models and Machine Learning’s impact on Operational Excellence, among other subjects.

My diverse writings of the year, spanning beyond 2023, covered topics from organizational innovation to AI critiques. Tenth place revisited my 2021 model for service organizations, while ninth playfully discussed the cat versus dog people dynamic. Criticizing LinkedIn’s AI articles for mediocrity claimed eighth place. Seventh introduced the CPORT task definition, sixth challenged the notion of complexity as a paradigm shift, and fifth dismissed transformation concepts in 2021. The fourth provided an organizational review outline without specifying its origin year. Securing top spots, third compiled Peter Block quotes from 2021, second explored leadership types in a 2023 podcast, and first delved into the Double Diamond’s attribution challenges, differing notably from my top LinkedIn posts.

Karim Knio & Margaux Schulz  
Published online: 13 Dec 2023

[https://doi.org/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936](https://doi.org/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936)

This Special Issue of Journal of Critical Realism (JCR) is dedicated to the 2022 International Association for Critical Realism (IACR) Conference, which was hosted by the International Institute of Social Sciences (ISS) in the Hague (Netherlands), part of the Erasmus University of Rotterdam. Its theme was ‘Realist Complexity, between Causal and Complex Systems’, although it also engaged with other pertinent subjects within critical realism research, including ecology, social work, health, ethics, and the interconnections between critical realism and other schools of thought like pragmatism and realist evaluation. The conference, along with the pre-conference, attracted over 120 participants from diverse backgrounds across 31 countries, indicating a growing interest in critical realism. Notably, about half of the attendees were PhD students, indicating the significance of the event in academic circles.

This special issue aims to showcase selected presentations from the conference, providing a diverse representation of the topics discussed across different panels, although it is not intended to be comprehensive. The conference theme sought to explore the potential contributions of critical realism to the study of complexity, as well as to address the criticisms faced by ‘complex realism’, a concept introduced in the 1990s (Byrne [Citation1998](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936#), [Citation2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936#); Reed and Harvey [Citation1992](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936#)). Complex realism aims to identify parallels between critical realism and complexity theory, but it has encountered criticism from within critical realism due to concerns that it conflates ontological levels (Holland [Citation2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767430.2024.2278936#)). To reinvigorate the discussion and develop a critical realist research agenda informed by complexity, the conference revisited the debates between complexity theory and critical realism, with a focus on three main thematic questions: ontological and epistemological domains, causality, and open/closed complex systems.

To represent the theoretical discussions that took place on complexity and complex systems, you will find in this issue two articles. The first article is by Leigh Price, and it sets the stage for the discussion by including a brief introduction to the field of systems theory. It argues that critical realism allows us to move beyond first generation (positivist) and second generation (hermeneuticist) approaches to systems theory towards a third-generation approach based on Bhaskar’s layered ontology. In third generation systems theory, the resolution of wicked (complex) problems, such as the socioecological crisis, involves correcting the method of homeostasis which in the context of society is our social method of finding knowledge about the best – most ethical – way to act. This homeostatic version of ethics assumes that, in the event of a problem that threatens our wellbeing, rather than correcting the consequences of the failure of homeostasis (the misguided action/behaviour based on misguided ethics), it is better to deal with the failure of the homeostatic mechanism itself (the mechanism by which we find truthful knowledge about the best way to act). This is a non-teleological approach to emancipation from ills and ‘it releases activists from having to be keepers of the moral high-ground or having to try to change people’s behaviour’.

The second article, titled ‘Complexity, trans-immanent systems and morphogenetic régulation: towards a problématique of calibration’ by Karim Knio, studies the intersection between critical realism and complexity theory via the philosophies of substance and persistence. Knio’s focus lies on Luhmann’s concept of autopoiesis, which refers to systems that self-reproduce. He argues that such systems are founded on a transcendental understanding of substance and a perduration account of persistence, implying that objects persist over time independently of their changing forms across different temporalities. In contrast, Knio introduces the immanent account of substance and exdurantist account of persistence through allopoiesis, where unanimated systems are defined by their qualities and only exist in time. However, to analyse complex systems comprehensively, both allopoietic and autopoietic systems must be considered. As such, and to overcome the paradox of substance, the development of a trans-immanent account of substance appears necessary. To achieve this, Knio employs Spinoza’s doctrine of parallelism and exemplifies its application through the Immanent Causality Morphogenetic Approach (ICMA) – French Régulation (FR) (Morphogenetic Régulation) model. In this article, Knio demonstrates how a trans-immanent system fits with CR via the Morphogenetic Régulation framework by exploring the theme of crisis in terms of the movement from inadequate to adequate understanding of objects in systemic environments (problématique of calibration).
