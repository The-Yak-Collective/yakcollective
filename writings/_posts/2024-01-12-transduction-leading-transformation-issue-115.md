Implicit in this statement is the existence of a high-risk group of people who should still be taking COVID precautions. Also implicit is the abandonment of collective care and public health, si…](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/hospitals-are-killing-patients-because?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

[Bloomberg · 6d**[] **The general election is now expected in the second half of the year, but many voters will go to the polls before that, for local and mayoral elections in May. The financial troubles facing local government – with Birmingham, Nottingham and Woking among councils effectively declaring bankruptcy – are sure to be an issue. We discuss the challenges with Cambridge University researcher Jack Shaw. Plus: our automotive editor Craig Trudell has been speaking to Technology and Decarbonisation Minister Anthony Browne about the government’s plans to increase the take-up of electric vehicles, despite slowing sales. Hosted by Stephen Carroll and Yuan Potts.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-01-05/bloomberg-uk-politics-council-cash-crunch-podcast)

[Are you a TPOTish person?](https://mastodon.social/@antlerboy/111704730652883089)  
Do fancy words and concepts like ‘liminal’ ‘adjacent possible’, ‘(il)legibilty’ and/or post/meta-rational and stuff mean something to you?  
Possibly you’re a bit neurospicy?  
Perhaps some of that makes it complex when people ask things like ‘what’s your purpose’? It’s hard to ‘set goals’?  
If so, this ChatGPT bot probably won’t help, but might be fun to explore! -)
