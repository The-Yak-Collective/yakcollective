Meetings: often dreaded, yet they hold an untapped potential to turn challenges into breakthroughs. In a world where time is a premium, it’s crucial to maximise the value of every interaction. How do we shift from seeing problems as roadblocks to viewing them as stepping stones for opportunities?

Let’s talk about the ‘Diamond Approach’ to meetings. It works for consultants engaged in sales – better still, it works for everyone trying to create opportunities in their day-to-day work and #management. It even works in #recruitment – whether you’re the interviewer or interviewee.

Picture a diamond: at its top, the opening, where we dive deep with questions. This isn’t just about surface-level issues; it’s about uncovering the real challenges at play. 

As we move through the diamond’s widest part, we engage in robust discussion. Here, each participant plays a vital role, contributing unique perspectives and insights. This is where the magic happens, where problems are dissected and understood.

Then, as we narrow down towards the bottom of the diamond, we focus on solutions, on turning our newfound understanding into actionable opportunities. This is where probing skills are crucial. It’s not just about finding any solution, but the right solution that aligns with our goals and values – and generates #innovation.

But what truly sets this approach apart is its emphasis on co-creation and co-learning. It’s not just about one person leading the charge; it’s about harnessing the collective intelligence of the group – the salesperson as facilitator, if you like.
