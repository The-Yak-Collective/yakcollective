- Organisational Cybernetics

### Upcoming Events:

**SE Stakeholder Engagement – Productive Conversations (0.5d)**

This training programme could equally be called ‘honest conversations’, ‘difficult conversations’, ‘constructive conversations’, or ‘challenging conversations’.

Fundamental to the success and flavour of organisational life – and systems practice interventions – are the quality of conversations we are able to have. If we can develop an honest and shared attempt to get at shared understanding – shared ‘truth’ if you like – or at least to fully appreciate each others’ understanding – then we can make true progress.

This interactive session will:

- Discuss different types of feedback / difficult conversation
- Understand how the brain rationalises and protect us
- Increase awareness of our own habits and perceptions
- Prepare and plan for a difficult conversation
- Have effective performance conversations
- Learn how to respond / look after yourself in the moment

And help you to have productive conversations even when it seems most unlikely. You will need to bring a record of an ‘unproductive’ conversation you have had, or fear having, and be prepared to work with others around it and other examples. You will end the session with the ability to surface more productive conversations even when it is difficult.

**ILG Large Group Interventions (1.0d)**

In a classic 2005 article, ‘Techniques to Match our Values’, Weisbord set out the ‘learning curve’, with a movement from ‘experts solve problems’ to ‘’everybody’ solves problems’ to ‘experts improve whole systems’ to ‘’everybody’ improves whole systems’. Inherent in the development of systems practice from the start has been recognition of ‘the whole’, which comes in various forms from group dynamics to organisational viability.

This programme will give an overview of intervention approaches which ‘bring whole systems into the room’ rather than have a few experts work on individual issues. We will look at some of the history and the wide range of interventions that have been developed, and provide an overview of some of the most interesting.

We will compare and contrast these approaches and provide ‘ways in’ to consider when, and which, large group intervention might be an appropriate part of a systems practice intervention.

**ICS3 Workshop Design (0.5d)**

This module provides learners with an understanding of the design of workshops and relevant considerations, taking into account the potentially very different contexts and definitions of what a ‘workshop’ is. It introduces a range of tools and approaches for workshop design, building on the facilitation module. It gives tools to consider evaluation and learning about workshop design, and compares various approaches, enabling learners to better select and apply appropriate workshop design approaches to their context.

A workshop can be distinguished from a meeting (though the boundaries may be blurry at times), by some of the following indicators:

- intensive discussion and activity, designed to progress thinking and planning
- intentionally designed activities (rather than simply an agenda), or flow
- an impact focus, usually above and beyond just a discussion or decision – some kind of output taking an intervention or initiative forward

An alternative use of the work, _to workshop (something)_, refers to taking a product or idea into a period of intense focused experimentation and development, often bringing in fresh or different perspectives than the original developers of the product or idea. This is of course closely related, but implies some partly-developed ‘content’ as the workshop focus, as opposed to simply a product or idea. In either case, some input is expected to a workshop, whether process, content, or both.

The learning will cover:

- What a workshop is
- Where and when we might use a workshop
- A range of tools and approaches
- How to appropriately select an approach, and design a workshop to fit the requirements in context
- The importance of reflection and how to evaluate and build a learning loop
- Workshop design tools, core and conceptual

This is a very practical, hands-on course based on you creating an initial workshop design from your context, using sources offered, and sharing and discussing it in the session.

This course complements the course on Facilitation for systems practice interventions, though they can be done independently or in any order.

**ICS2 Facilitation Skills for Systems Practice Interventions (0.5d)**

This course provides learners with an understanding of the facilitation relationship in the context of systems intervention itself, and of the challenges it brings. It introduces a range of tools and practices for facilitation and provides guidance on workshop planning. Finally, it compares various approaches to facilitation, enabling learners to develop a stronger sense of the kind of facilitator they want to be.

Topics covered include:

- The facilitraining rainbow – where do you stand? 
- Divergence, emergence, convergence; 
- Differentiation and integration method; 
- Adaptive change; 
- Facilitation for ‘robust systems’; 
- Session planning and session flow; 
- The perceptual positions; 
- Ground rules for workshops and ways into partnership; 
- Maintaining your authenticity; 
- Peter Block’s ‘six conversations that matter’; 
- Chris Corrigan’s ‘seven little helpers’; 
- Hosting and guiding and/or customer services; 
- Context cues; 
- History and three futures; 
- Power tools and making concrete – Naming The Thing.

**ICS1b Consulting for Systems Practice Interventions – (b) Core (0.5d)**

This course provides learners with a deeper understanding of:

- Discovery and research into the client system; 
- Power questions, layers of analysis, and objectifying ‘the system’; 
- Research and action-based approaches; 
- Third-party and whole systems approaches; 
- Maintaining the balance of responsibility for deep engagement; 
- Structuring analysis and feedback, developing commitment; 
- Choosing dirty or clean consulting. 

To maximise your chances of being effective in achieving positive change, you should combine a sound understanding of systems approaches with well-developed intervention skills.

This in turn requires a clear conception of the role of the systems practitioner as ‘consultant’, of their relationships with stakeholders, especially the ‘client’, and the nature of the practitioner’s influence on the organisations they seek to transform.

Drawing on Flawless Consulting, Barry Oshry’s Organic Systems Framework, and more, _Consulting for Systems Practice Interventions_ emphasises a collaborative approach and equal responsibility between the intervention practitioner and the client, navigating a path between the twin traps of ‘consultant as boss’ and ‘consultant as servant’.

These courses are relevant to anyone – consultant or not! – who is engaging in organisational change.

**ICS1a Consulting for Systems Practice Interventions – (a) Foundation (0.5d)**

This course will provide learners with key principles and a structure for interventions. Topics covered include:

- The five phases of the consultative process;
- ‘Techniques are not enough’: relationships in consulting;
- Dealing with ‘the space of service’;
- Setting up a clear ‘contract’ for interventions – including triangular and rectangular contracting;
- Authenticity and setting your assumptions;
- The client behind the client and the problem behind the problem;

### My Weekly Blog post:

Meetings, often dreaded, possess untapped potential for transforming challenges into breakthroughs. To maximize every interaction, we must shift from viewing problems as roadblocks to seeing them as opportunities. I propose the ‘Diamond Approach’ to meetings, applicable to sales, management, and recruitment. Imagine a diamond: we start at the top, delving deep with questions to uncover real challenges. Moving through robust discussions, each participant contributes unique insights. At the diamond’s base, we focus on solutions, probing for those aligning with goals and fostering innovation. This approach emphasizes co-creation and co-learning, harnessing collective intelligence. I advocate for active facilitation, not one person leading but the group’s synergy driving progress. Ensuring meetings transcend mere talks involves structuring them as journeys from problem to opportunity, fostering engagement and actionable outcomes. Let’s embrace the diamond’s facets to unlock meeting potential and drive meaningful progress together.

Abstract

We introduce an algebraic analogue of dynamical systems, based on term rewriting. We show that a recursive function applied to the output of an iterated rewriting system defines a formal class of models into which all the main architectures for dynamic machine learning models (including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and diffusion models) can be embedded. Considered in category theory, we also show that these algebraic models are a natural language for describing the compositionality of dynamic models. Furthermore, we propose that these models provide a template for the generalisation of the above dynamic models to learning problems on structured or non-numerical data, including ‘hybrid symbolic-numeric’ models.

_Thinking Through Archaeological Complexity: Leveraging high performance computing, network science, and agent-based models to understand Australia’s deep past ​ Tuesday Jan 30, 2024   11:30-1:00PM 747 Weiser Hall Stefani Crabtree Department of Environment and Society, Utah State University There will be coffee and snacks. The talk will be recorded for later viewing. Link to full event listingAbstract: Complex adaptive systems science provides ways to examine relationships among individuals in the archaeological past. Through these methods we directly observe the impacts of individuals’ decisions (in the case of agent-based modeling) or their relationships to other individuals (in the case of network analysis) and then examine the effects of these behaviors on larger societal structures. Approaches from complex adaptive systems thus help advance archaeological research to study not just the tangible (artifacts) but the intangible and invisible (relationships). In this talk I highlight how tools from complex adaptive systems science have helped solve debates on when and how the peopling of Australia happened, and how people have been fundamental components in ecosystems for generations. This work has applicability to other systems worldwide, both in the past and into the future. Archaeology helps us understand vexing problems today by illustrating the trajectories of past societies, allowing us to see the long-term consequences of human decisions.Add to Google Calendar Upcoming Events  CSCS Seminar, Thursday, February 1, 2024: Twists, triangles, and tentacles: A guided tour of high-dimensional basins in networked dynamical systems, Yuanzhao Zhang, Postdoctoral Fellow, Santa Fe Institute.

Abstract

> _Liberating Structures (LS) is a repertoire of open source protocols and an innovative set of rules to guide routine interactions in board rooms, classrooms, and community forums. LS specifies how people are included and participate in ways that sets them free from unwitting patterns that exclude, stifle, and over-control. With deliberate irony, LS employs structural constraints to liberate. Codified in the early 2000s, LS consist of 10 principles and 33 practical methods versatile enough for anyone to use for a wide array of purposes and group processes. The transdisciplinary attributes of LS arise from its complexity science roots. The focus is on relationship patterns rather than individual behavior. LS makes it possible to work with complexity instead of engineering it away, and hence generates options where none existed. Every LS protocol in the repertoire has the same minimalistic “DNA” of five micro-structuring elements. LS use has spread across diverse organization types, social movements, and disciplines._

**Practical Workshop**

Dive into Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) in our concise workshop lead by strategy and organisational clarity-maker Adam Thompson.

We’ll see how to apply this powerful tool for diagnosing and improving any purposeful system, which of course includes organisations.

We ask that you bring along your most pressing organisational pathology so we can apply the model in real-time to create insight and solutions while showing you how to put it to use.

Adam has a wonderful way of explaining complex concepts in a simple and fun way without losing the essence of the concepts.

He has a video that explains VSM in 2 minutes accessible from here:

**Facilitator: Adam Thompson**  
Since 2012, Adam has been helping leaders get strategic, organisational and leadership clarity so their organisations can be successful. With over 25 years of organisational leadership experience, the trademark of his work is engaging expertise with a touch of humour (because real change needs it!), bringing together a vast and evolving knowledge of strategic, organisational, systems and people models to create insight and understandings that are bespoke for each situation.

Prior to establishing his consulting practice, he was part of the Executive at RAA, earlier work saw success in senior roles in the insurance, finance, education and legal industries, both in Australia and in the UK. His formal qualifications are in Economics and Law and he is a qualified Barrister and Solicitor in South Australia while successfully avoiding actual working as one! He also holds certification from the Institute For Development Coaching for providing feedback and tailored coaching on the Leadership Maturity Framework.

Outside of work and his busy family, he is the Soccer Coordinator for his children’s school and lives essentially the exact opposite life to Jason Bourne.

Abstract: This essay investigates the radical reconceptualization of communication demonstrated in Kazuo Ishiguro’s _Never Let Me Go_ (2005). In the novel, Ishiguro depicts communication not as a means to establish mutual understanding, but as an autonomous phenomenon independent from the participants, which I call dislocated communication. I articulate this notion of communication following from Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory. In deploying this framework, I argue that Ishiguro positions dislocated communication as the reality of communication, in turn obliging readers to experience the otherness of clones as epistemologically inaccessible since the readers, too, participate in communication with the novel’s protagonist narrator, Kathy H.

John Conway’s Game of Life, a famous cellular automaton, has been found to have periodic patterns of every possible length.

This pattern in the Game of Life repeats itself after 41 steps. Its recent discovery ends a decades-long quest to show that Life is omniperiodic.

Dr. M Zargham  
From Viable Organizations to Viable Ecologies  
Jan 31st. 5:00- 6:30 pm (UK wintertime)

This workshop presents an approach to organizational analysis and design, leveraging Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) as well as methods for mapping an organization’s environment and its interactions across a range of regulatory modalities. The first part of the workshop is a presentation which explores how these models can be applied to understand an organization’s infrastructures and internal dynamics in relation to external environmental pressures. Specifically, these models are applied to the analysis of an organization developed by the speaker over the past 7 years, alongside many collaborators.

The second part of the workshop is a guided discussion which explores the potential of emerging technologies to foster networks of smaller, self-governed entities – as compared to the common monolithic organizational archetypes. This segment explores how new technologies can support the development and maintenance of organizational infrastructures that increase viability without loss of variety. Attendees will brainstorm environmental forces such organizations must navigate, as well as the tools and practices available to ride or buttress against those forces – concluding with a discussion of potentially actionable steps toward this future.

Michael Zargham is the founder and Chief Engineer at BlockScience, as well as a board member and research director at the Metagovernance Project. He holds a PhD in Electrical and Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on Optimal Dynamic Resource Allocation Policies in Networks. Zargham’s research focus is on Generalized Dynamical Systems with special attention to complex networked systems. This research has been applied in the design and analysis of systems across the domains of governance, economics, and technology. His work has been funded by a variety of sources including private businesses, governments, NGOs, and non-profits.

Professor Andrew Pickering  
Cybernetics and the Environmental Crisis  
March the 6th. 5:00- 6:30 pm (UK)

Foreshadowing the disasters of the Anthropocene, in the late 1960s Gregory Bateson developed a cybernetic analysis of the environmental crisis which was then starting to be recognised. He argued that its roots lay in dualist fantasies of control of nature which inevitably produced unintended and sometimes catastrophic spin-offs—Silent Spring. The implication Bateson drew was that we need to think differently, non-dualistically. We have to understand that we are not the masters, not in control. But thinking is not so much the problem as acting. Our actions, not our thoughts, were killing the songbirds, exterminating whole species and filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. In this talk I therefore want to explore a distinctively cybernetic pattern of acting in the world.

Taking as my example adaptive attempts to restore the ecosystem of the Colorado River, I seek to map out a stance in the world that I call acting with nature, in contrast to our usual stance of acting on it—in Heideggerian terms a stance of poiseis rather than enframing—characterised by an experimental attunement to nature’s emergent agency—finding out what natural systems want to do and finding ways to get along with that. Acting as if we are indeed part of a world which we cannot control but are swept up in. I discuss the exploratory phase of acting-with as the staging of a dance of human and nonhuman agency, with a dynamically regularised choreography of agency as a possible endpoint.

I emphasise the performative skeleton of adaptive management (and of the style of cybernetics I have written about before): it is primarily about doing things in the world, not anything cognitive: knowledge, calculation, science. In that sense, my example outlines a way of ‘doing without science,’ a different paradigm from modernity. But going one step further, we can note the ancillary role of scientific modelling in our example, which I try to understand along the lines of Stafford Beer’s remarks in 1968 on ‘continually aborting’ corporate plans.

Given time, I can mention other examples of cybernetic acting-with, including the Room for the River project in western Europe, an approach to ‘natural farming’ developed in Japan, Aboriginal techniques of fire-control in Australia, and Amazonian animism. Though not an immediate antidote to the Anthropocene, I think these are the sorts of practices that can in time chip away at it from below.

Dr. Pile Bunnel  
‘Language as an Enabling Constraint for Viability’  
April the 3rd, 2024. 5:00-6:30 pm (UK summertime)

We are usually unaware that language imposes constraints on how we perceive, think and act, even as it is central to all that we do. What language enables is clearly apparent: all the cultures, technologies and designs we humans have created are grounded in our ability to coordinate with each other as we plan, organize, act and create, and evaluate what we have done. What language constrains and hides is far more difficult to see, yet there are clues in our experiences. I will delve into some of those clues to provide grounds for reflections and conversations concerning how our vocabulary biases what we can do and how we do it. What, for example, do some of our distinctions—such as for example “system”, “feedback”, “observer” and “recursion” enable us to see and think about while at the same time, what other thoughts and actions are made invisible or inaccessible by how we understand and use these words? This has consequences for viability and ethical living, as that requires that we be able to harmonize with both the obvious and the implicit, the visible and the hidden dimensions of our lives on this planet.

Pille has a background in ecology and ethology. After finishing her doctorate studies in Berkeley half a century ago, she began her professional life as a research associate at the University of British Columbia, followed by nearly two decades as an international environmental consultant. Leaving the consulting field, she taught postgraduate courses in systems methods and systems thinking at Royal Roads University for a further couple of decades and became active with several professional systems societies (ASC, ISSS and CybSoc).

Dr. Peter Robertson  
The Sapient Paradox as the consequence of a  
cybernetical bifurcation in the evolution.  
May the 8th, 2024, 5:00-6:30 pm (UK)

My presentation intends to illustrate one different view on the cybernetical history of humankind that is emerging in the natural sciences, not to assume any answer but to inspire more exploratory questions.

Why did humankind create such a moral and ecological mess of this world, and why have we done that for only about 10,000 years? This question might be related to the Sapient Paradox, which emerged after decades of archeological and neurophysiological research (Donald, 2009; Iriki, Suzuki, Tanaka, Bretas Vieira, & Yamazaki, 2021; Renfrew, 1996, 2007, 2008a, 2008b; Renfrew, Frith, & Malafouris, 2009; van der Leeuw, Lane, & Read, 2009). As we know it today, the human brain has been in its actual shape for at least about 60,000 years and probably much longer. Still, the explosion of human development and rational thinking only happened at the beginning of the Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago, just a fraction of the 3.7 billion years of life on Earth. This “explosion of human development” happened without any change in the brain. During these 3.7 billion years, evolution developed the complexity of life as we observe it today. Until 10,000 years ago, the complete diversity and interactions of living forms were part of a self-organizing, ecologically controlled system. The rhythms of life cycles of birth, growth, and death kept the system surviving and becoming more complex during evolution. From our modern human perspective, it took millions of years for this process to see a recognizable change. We are used to calling this “slow.” The human brain was no exception, inspiring Renfrew in 1966 to ask: “What created the modern mind without changing the brain’s anatomy? The human brain today is not different from 60,000 years ago, but the behavior is.

The short answer is that humankind started becoming sedentary, externalizing its behavior (= non-ecological manipulation of an ecosystem), disconnecting from the rhythm of nature, and escaping ecological control, causing an exponential process with a speed of change never seen before in 3.7 billion years. The consequences of this ecological dislodgment might have been the cause of the derailment from the ecological order, allowing both so-called human advances and an ecological and cognitive mess in this world to emerge. For a species to survive in evolution, it needed to have enough complexity to match the complexity in the environment. To match a complex system, one needs to be as smart as the system, maybe a little bit smarter, but not much. Evolution doesn’t waste energy being smart without a purpose. Ashby’s law of requisite variety is the scientific version of this principle. Combined with the law of least action, it also means that the brain could only evolve as brilliantly as the environmental ecosystem but never much brighter. Without any option to change the brain and its integration within the ecological environment, derailment might have been the only way to escape ecological control and grow as fast as humankind did without becoming smarter. The cause of today’s moral and ecological mess might be the same that created all human progress. Another related paradox is that the advances of the last 10,000 years might not be caused by human beings being smarter than nature but, in reality, being more stupid. Being less smart than nature might have been, and still might be, a fundamental condition for escaping ecological control and creating a non-ecological exponential development speed.

Peter Robertson focuses on decision-maker dynamics in business transformation. He has over 30 years of experience as an international corporate adviser at KPMG (Amsterdam) and Human Insight (London) and as an executive lecturer and associate professor at universities in the Netherlands, China, and the USA. Peter developed an organization-ecological assessment suite of tools, available in sixteen languages, based on the work of Nobel laureates Lorenz and Tinbergen. He is the author of “Always Change a Winning Team,” which describes the early development and history of the organization-ecological approach.

Peter works primarily with boardrooms, executives, and senior teams of high-tech, telecom, financial industry, and medical technology firms. This includes large corporates and startups located in Europe and the USA. Peter teaches at the Nyenrode Business University in the Netherlands and is an associate of Change Logic, Boston, USA. His focus is organization-ecology, culture-independent ways of cooperation, and life-cycle dynamics. He is a member of the International Society of Systems Sciences and the American Society of Cybernetics. Before building his career in corporate life, Peter studied medicine and worked in immunology at the University of Amsterdam and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota). He later specialized as a psychiatrist-psychotherapist, with a sub-specialization in neurology.

Backward compatibility for OPCAT models

Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a language and approach for modeling and communicating the architecture and detailed design of complex systems of all kinds, based on a minimal universal ontology of objects and processes that transform them. By using intuitive yet formal graphics and natural language text, OPM models communicate what systems do, why and how they do it, as well as what they require to accomplish these tasks.

[Riding Dynamics – Kerry Turner (online book)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2024/01/22/riding-dynamics-kerry-turner-online-book/)

> _[Application of systems dynamics models to horseriding]_
> 
> _In this book Kerry Turner has challenged the rider – not just to improve but to really “think” about what they are doing.   It is clear throughout that the author believes that the good rider should be a lifelong student of this absorbing art and it is because I wholeheartedly agree with her that I am delighted to write this Foreword.   Riding is an art that involves another living being, the horse, who is as unique and individual as us. The difference between the rider and the horse is that the horse is not a volunteer. As a result we owe it to him to constantly strive to improve our skills and “connection” with him if his welfare is to be uppermost in our hearts and minds, which should be the case for all good horsemen.   All too often good horsemanship is sadly measured by how many competitions have been won or difficult horses conquered, when in reality it should be measured by a state of peaceful agreement and co-operation between horse and rider – in other words HARMONY.   Good harmony can only be achieved by understanding oneself first and then the horse, along with a sound grasp of technical skills. When the rider is truly aware of this and is committed to constantly strive to improve, only then can he or she reap the rewards this lifelong journey will bring.   I know that by reading this book your own and your individual horse’s journey can only be enhanced.     Patrick Print FBHS Chairman The British Horse Society July 2007_

**Why Emergence and Self-Organization are Conceptually Simple, Common and Natural**

**Abstract** : Emergent properties are properties of a whole that cannot be reduced to the properties of its parts. Properties of a system are defined as relations between a particular input given to a system and its corresponding output. From this perspective, whole systems formed by coupling component systems have properties different from the properties of their components. Wholes tend to arise spontaneously through a process of self-organization, in which components randomly interact until they settle in a stable configuration that in general cannot be predicted from the properties of the components. That configuration constrains the relations between the components, thus defining emergent “laws” that downwardly cause the further behavior of the components. Thus, emergent wholes and their properties arise in a simple and natural manner.

[Aspects of Cybernetics – website section – Jenkinson (2021)](https://stream.syscoi.com/2024/01/20/aspects-of-cybernetics-website-section-jenkinson-2021/)

LINK: [https://cybsoc.org/?page\_id=1668](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1668)

Covers:

**Fundamentals:**

This is the [core of cybernetic theory](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1539) and practice, the essentially transdiciplinary from which all the specialist fields grow and feed back.

This is an essential field of enquiry and learning.

Think of context and feedback and variety, of markers and cues and signs, of navigation and outcome…

**Design:**

Almost all cybernetic activity that is not pure theory is also [design work](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1462), incldujgn the design of scientific method, of theory, of its communication.

But there are also core fields recognised as belonging to design such as…

Architecture and interior design

Business design

Apps, products, services and materials design — R&D, innovation

Designing social futures and what is needed for them

[Methods design](https://cybsoc.org/?eventbrite_events=design-decisions-and-police-practice-the-presidents-series), such as Agile and Lean

Social planning and social architecture

Ethical aspects of design.

For the specialist there is a long and nuanced list. Tags can be used to mark these.

**Knowing:**

[This includes](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1463)

Philosophy and history of science, and scientific paradigms and cybernetics as revolutionary or stable social processes

Core tools and concepts of cybernetics and their implications, including Ternary Theory, Directiveness, Context, Feedback, Cues and Signals, and more

Scientific Method & Philosophy of Science

Cross Discipline/Trans-Discipline/Integration as practice

Second, recursive, reflexive, and observer-dependent orders of science and cybernetics; observation and interpretation, constructivism

Noetic Sciences — a very long list related to what and how we know, how we understand mind, and how we work with it… Consider just these…

Appearances

Artificial intelligence as a concept and paradigm

Autonomy and freedom, agency

Brain, nervous system, and brain sciences

Cognition and sensory perception

Cognition

Cognitive biases, frames, and paradigms

Communication — in nature, humans, machines

Concepts and ideas and what they are or do

Consciousness studies

Constructivism, idealism

Context theory

Cross discipline/trans discipline/integration as practice

Cybernetic influence on scientific paradigms

Determinism

Directiveness and autonomy

Double bind and other pathologies

Embodied intelligence

Emotion (affect, feelings) and its effects and intelligence

Epistemology and Ontology

Neuroscience and Psychological Theories…

[And more](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1463)

**Matter:**

Physics and chemistry especially work with material substances and the forces and organization of these, but they play a role in many fields. But from the design of research to the construction of things out of these materials and substances for a purpose, cybernetics can and does play a useful role. It dances with

Physical and Chemical Organization

Catalysis and Autocatalysis

Organic products, eg protein.

Physico-Chemical Self Organization

Anatomy and the physiome

Global Warming

Gaia

[ and so on..](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1464).

**Life:**

All Life Sciences

Formative principles of life and ecology, eg Context and Feedback, Persistence and Change, Individuation and Speciation.

Systems Biology & Morphology, inc genome and physionome studies

Autopoiesis

Ethology

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)

Veterinary Science

Ecology and Ecosystems

Evolution

[and so on](https://cybsoc.org/?page_id=1465)…

**Machine:**

Machine Cybernetics and a few more…

Robotics

AI software

Autonomous vehicles, autopilots…

Assistive tech, eg for surgery

Designing machine systems, e.g. AI, IoT, software, and other smart technologies

Ethical and functional consequences

Homeostatic devices and signal systems

Smart software systems (feedback and controls)

Software systems and coding practices

The internet

Semantic web and advanced coding

People:

Sociology and Anthropology

Sociology and social structuration, and its concepts, eg recursive situations, context, reflexive monitoring of the flux of encounters, speech acts, Erving Goffman face-to-face social interaction as a PCT theorist…

Social Ecology/social autopoiesis

Economics, macro and micro, Nudge, behavioural economics

Integrated Sociology: General theory, Political Theory; Economic Theory, Cultural Theory

Social anthropology

History 

Human Synthesis & Meta Levels, eg

Domain Analysis & Transdisciplinary Methods

Therapeutics (inc Psychotherapy, PCT Theory of Levels, Medical Science)

Social Planning

Aid and development

Crisis Solutions ( Global Warming, Degradation, Political Breakdown, Etc)

Change Design

Governance and the law

Education & training

Design thinking and practices

Architecture

Social planning and social architecture

Product design

**Systems:**

How important has systemic thinking become!

Cybernetics is routinely equated with the systems sciences, but despite its affinities with all of them, it has a particular orientation that marks a distinction. Yet many problems are resolved when a systems discipline is united with a cybernetic.

Systems science disciplines

[See the introduction](https://cybsoc.org/aspects-of-cybernetics/systems/) to consider this further and perhaps [write an article](https://cybsoc.org/publish-article/).

**Management:**

Management is cybernetic. So is Government and its political practices. Cybernetics dances with all the following…

Management Theory, Identity, Culture, Business Models

Organization theory, structure and design

Policy formation and control, Governance, steering tools

 Strategy, research, planning, decision making, adaptation

Innovation, problem solving, design and execution of change

Administration and unit/team organization

Marketing, Sales, Brand, Pricing, value propositions and offerings

Financial systems

Production systems

Value streams, processes, circular economy, ecosystem

Cybernetic tools, including VSM

Extended corporate machine intelligences.

[Bristol University Press · Oct 1, 2023  **Tracing 25 years of ‘initiativitis’ in central government attempts to join up local public services in England ** Over the last 25 years, central government has attempted to join up local public services in England on at least 55 occasions, illustrating the ‘initiativitis’ inflicted upon local governments by the large volume and variety of coordination programmes. By analysing and mapping some of the characteristics of these initiatives, we have uncovered insights into the ways central government has sought to achieve local coordination. We observe a clear preference for the use of funding and fiscal powers as a lever, a competitive allocation process, and a constrained discretion model of governance, with some distinct patterns over time. These choices made in the design of initiatives are likely to be shaped by the perceived and real accountability structures within government, and so offer an opportunity to consider how accountability affects, and is affected by, particular programmatic efforts at a local level. This article makes a significant contribution to our understanding of coordination programmes at a central–local government level. By identifying patterns in the approach of government over the last 25 years, it offers an empirical lens to map the ‘glacial and incremental’ reframing of central–local relations and associated shifts in public accountability. In this way, the article provides more solid foundations to a range of issues – central government’s reliance on controlling the reins of funding, the competitive nature of allocation processes, and the enduring centralisation of accountability – that have been much discussed among policymakers, practitioners and researchers, but have lacked clear empirical grounding. ](https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/pp/51/4/article-p695.xml)
