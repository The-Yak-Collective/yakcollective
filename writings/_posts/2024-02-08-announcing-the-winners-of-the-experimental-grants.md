_Posted on February 8th, 2024_

A month ago, I [announced](https://twitter.com/neuranne/status/1742602163954593808) that I would celebrate my 34th birthday by giving away $3400 to help four people become scientists of their own life. I encouraged people to [submit](https://nesslabs.com/grants) proposals for a personal experiment they wanted to run, where $850 would help make it happen.

The format could be a collection of essays, a podcast miniseries, a research paper, a simple web app, a series of illustrations or video, an in-person conference… To maximize positive impact, I asked that there would ideally be some form of artifact people can consume at scale.

Then, my friend [Andrew Nalband](https://twitter.com/nalband) said he’d add $600 to the grant to celebrate his own 42th birthday, which meant we could have three additional smaller grants to give away.

Still, with more than 100 applications, it was a very difficult decision to make. The grant winners and finalists you will see below are a testament to the curiosity and creativity of the Ness Labs community. I’m so grateful I got to learn about each of these ideas.

And now, without further ado…

## The winning experiments

First, we have the four main winners, who will each receive $850 to bring their experiment to life. Here they are, in no particular order:

![Ness Labs Experimental Grants Winners](https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ness-labs-experimental-grants-banner-winners-1024x576.png)

### _Grant Winner: Robin Torres Gouzerh (United States)_

“Our idea is to integrate art, academic research, and scientific investigation to produce an artifact presenting the medicinal, societal, and interpersonal merits of psilocybin. This project is envisioned as an ongoing, long-term commitment and each iteration will touch on a different theme. The focus of this first effort is psilocybin. More specifically, the project is about how the compound can act as a bridge to expand thoughts and emotions beyond commonly accepted limitations. The artifact will consist of a boxed set of reinterpreted and revisited “universal” cards and a companion booklet.” – [@RobinTorresGouzerh](https://www.instagram.com/robintorresgouzerh/)

**Why:** I have experienced firsthand the power of psychedelics, which have helped me overcome a lifelong struggle with depression and alcohol abuse. I’m excited to support a project that will hopefully increase awareness of the benefits of psilocybin mushrooms.

### _Grant Winner: Citra Cas (Indonesia)_

“I saw so many pets having to endure pain for years because the current prosthetic solutions, even the 3D printed ones, are too expensive. They are expensive for pet owners, even more so for those which are living in animal shelters. 3D printed materials offer wider and cheaper alternatives, allowing for faster design iterations to finetune the mechanics and design of the model. It unlocks physical properties that conventional materials couldn’t achieve, and I’m experimenting with that.

I made the preliminary 3D models of the designs, and I’m currently in the phase of refining it. I would use the $850 to make 3D print prototypes of this preliminary design and cover travel expenses to meet the experts I’m working with in person. One of the experts I’m working with is a biotech researcher living in Vietnam. She has been working in an animal healthcare NGO for 25 years and she owns an animal shelter for stray cats and dogs. I hope to be able to visit her in person to discuss the physical prototype even further, to assess specific cases for different types of specific prosthetics, and learn a lot from the whole experience.”

**Why:** I love animals and I had no idea this was a problem. I like that this is a clever use of 3D technology. More affordable 3D printed prosthetics for pets who need them sounds like a great product to help bring to the world.

### _Grant Winner: Chloe Loose, with a little help from Dad (United Kingdom)_

“Open source air purification for me and other kids. With my dad, I will be taking my existing paint box and adding sensors in places to measure the particles at different points inside the box. We will change the box from having just a fan to having a filter box that I can remove to change filters and add more fans to the inside. I will add different filters and collect data from the sensors to see how the different filters change the air. One of the sensors that we will make will be hand held so I can measure the effect outside the box as well. I then want to make a bigger version of my filter to see if it can filter the air in an entire room. I will use the money to buy parts to make the sensors and different filters and fans. All project files will be available for kids on GitHub.” — Chloe is 8 years old so she doesn’t have any social media.

**Why:** Air quality is an issue I recently started paying attention to [thanks to my friend Steph Smith](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1740525376315838618). I was already intrigued but then I clicked on the video pitch Chloe included, where she gives a proper presentation with a slides deck, and realized that she was probably the youngest applicant! I love how curious and creative she is, and I’m delighted to support this project. Also, kudos to her dad for encouraging her to apply.

### _Grant Winner: Monica Deu (Spain)_

“I will create a digital meta-space to share resources, tools and reflections for navigating the process of grieving. I would also like to create a community around the platform for those who are more alone or accompany each other, sharing moments, feelings, through a platform like Discord or Slack. Finally, I am starting to write a book about everything I have been writing and reading about grief, learning about how my brain was processing the pain. For this book, I am interviewing people who are grieving or have grieved and also experts in the field, and I would like to be able to use part of the money to pay them something symbolic for their contribution. My idea is to create a book that collects all the interviews as well as some first chapters about my own grief process and what science, arts and other cultures know about what is involved in living through grief.”

**Why:** I have lost a few people close to my heart the past few years, and found the process of grieving both difficult and beautiful. I’m curious to see what a place where people can explore grief in a more generative way may look like.

In addition to the four main winners, and thanks to Andrew’s generosity, we also have 3 additional winners, who will receive a smaller of $200 each:

**Grant winner: Yaa Addae from Ghana –** “Who is treated as worthy of care and in what ways does design, from architecture to public transport routes, reinforce this? ‘Designing Care Futures’ is a workbook for imagining both new and strengthening pre-existing infrastructures of care. A mixture of essays, case studies, and exercises, this is a key resource for designers and people invested in integrating a care ethic into their decision-making.”

**Grant winner: Natalia Talkowska from the UK –** “The essence of my project is the creation of a unique line of ‘How are You?’ cards, each intricately designed to foster emotional well-being and deeper personal connections. Unlike typical greeting cards, these are specifically crafted to encourage genuine communication about one’s mental state in a thoughtful, engaging manner. The long-term objective is to establish a sustainable model where the sales of the cards support ongoing production, distribution, and charitable contributions. The project will adapt and evolve based on feedback, potentially expanding into digital versions or interactive online platforms.”

**Grant winner: Jonathan Fisher from the USA –** “Studies have found that people who tell highly coherent stories (ones with foreshadowing and without extraneous details) tend to be happier two years later. Participation in storytelling is good for everyone, not just the ones that make a living out of it. Using an LLM to map the layout of time-dependent stories at scale. I will use an LLM to map the layout of time-dependent stories at scale. exploring how the story structures across a number of films relate, studying the similarity in the rhythm of the story beats, understanding the trends between them and assessing how the estimates compare to actual film, and creating a paper.”

## Full list of finalists

There were 100+ applications from 30+ countries. I was blown away by the quality of the applications, and wish I could have supported more experiments. Everyone who applied was considered a finalist, and my shortlist was actually a very long list.

![Countries of applicants for Ness Labs Experimental Grants 2024](https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/countries-experimental-grants-2024-1024x523.png)

To support their vision, encourage them to keep on exploring their curiosity, and help them connect with fellow curious minds, all finalists received a one-year pass to the Ness Labs private community.

In addition, I’m sharing the full list of experiments below so if you see something you like and have some disposable income you’d like to use to help bring one to life, you can contact the finalists directly via their social media profile.
