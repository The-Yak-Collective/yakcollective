I am taking a spring break starting today. Regular programming will probably resume in mid-April or so. For paid subscribers, billing will be paused until I hit the resume button. Your next bill date will be pushed out appropriately. If you have 12 days left on a monthly subscription right now, you’ll still have 12 days left when I resume. If you have 289 days left on an annual subscription, you’ll still have 289 days.

You’ll still have access to the [archives](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) as usual of course, so you can catch up on stuff you might have missed.

**During this hiatus, it will not be possible to sign up for a paid subscription if you don’t already have one, so the paywalled archives will be unavailable to new readers.**
