We work to transform public services, and ourselves.

And we put three core principles into practice:

**Social and environmental justice**

We believe that the purpose of public service is to enable better citizen and community outcomes.

Therefore, we put equality, diversity, and inclusion at the heart of transformation.

Weâ€™ve believed this our entire careersâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut things havenâ€™t changed as much as they should have done. The pressure for justice is only going to get strongerâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe all need to take responsibility.

**We offer impactful, sustainable, and progressive methods and points of intervention, ** underpinned by some beliefs:

â€¢ digitalâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe take the emerging world seriously

â€¢ agileâ€Šâ€”â€Šit is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking thank think yourself into a new way of acting

â€¢ systems and complexity, systems leadershipâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe work of leadership is fundamentally complex

â€¢ the community paradigmâ€Šâ€”â€Šre-focusing on citizen and community outcomes

â€¢ doing ourselves out of a job: building client capability and our leadership of the Public Service Transformation Academy are at the heart of our brand

**Experienced, authentic delivery together**

We put the spirit and reality of adult-to-adult relationships and partnering into practice

â€¢ We offer practised, capable, outcome-focused, skilled, and productive people

â€¢ We do the hard work thatâ€™s really needed to make a difference

â€¢ We form one team with you and work together

â€¢ We do what you need as well as what you ask for in the contract

â€¢ We offer authenticity and honesty

It seems to be working! Weâ€™ve been going for 15 years nowâ€Šâ€”â€Šand consistently had clients return and great people working with us, despite the turmoil in UK public services.

If this post seems self-congratulatoryâ€Šâ€”â€Šguilty as charged  ![ðŸ™‚](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png)
