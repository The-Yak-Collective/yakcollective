My buddy Luke recently started a band called Tattoo Mustache. While we were chatting, his eyes lit up talking about jamming in the studio with his bandmates - his arms were flailing and you could feel the energy coming off him like steam from a hot pan. These weekly jam sessions are something magical - _“You can just rent a studio for 3 hours”_ he said _“it’s like $150 and they have a drum kit and keyboard and everything!”_.
