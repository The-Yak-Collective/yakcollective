At [**The Public Service Transformation Academy**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/), we believe in the power of:

â€“ adult learning:  **#development**  not  **#training**

â€“ action learning: putting ideas into practice, immediately

â€“ peer learning: mutual support and sharing wisdom

We took these ideas from the Commissioning Academy, that we took over from the Cabinet Officer in 2016, to deliver transformational learning that can improve your skills and drive real change in public services.

This spring, we have three new programmesâ€Šâ€”â€Šplease help us to spread the word!

â€“ our Contract Management programmeâ€Šâ€”â€Šback by popular demand

â€“ the National Commissioning Academy, kindly hosted by the [**Royal Borough of Greenwich**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)

â€“ a ten-step introduction to outcome-based  **#commissioning**

\>\>Contract Management

We support and challenge you to approach contract management not legalistically but with an outcome focus, considering VFM, social value, and the evidence base for future decision-making. Public services including central government, councils, OPCCs, and charities use contracts in many different areas, so our guests and hosts have deep experience across the board. [**Paul Rackham**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) has extensive experience around Health and Social Care, [**Jim Nicholls**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) has worked in many different areas of contracting in the public and private sector. All facilitators and guest speakers have experience on both sides of a contract and share their â€˜lived experienceâ€™ as well as the theory. In short, snappy two-hour online sessions we take you through the stages of the contracting lifecycle, honing in on key themes, challenges and opportunities.

\>\>Ten steps to outcome-based commissioning

This fun, challenging, and creative online programme has a laser focus on outcomes and constructive approaches, from strengths-based commissioning to â€˜whole system workingâ€™, helping you to innovate, lead, co-produce, and move from â€˜quick fixâ€™ to â€˜stay fixedâ€™.

\>\>The National Commissioning Academy

Our flagship programme, the Academy blends in-person anchor daysâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis time in Greenwichâ€Šâ€”â€Šwith action learning, webinars, online support, and application. Weâ€™ve been improving the programme for ten yearsâ€Šâ€”â€Šitâ€™s challenging, sometimes mind-blowing, fun, and a deep look at how to shape all available resources to achieve outcomes that really matter for citizens and communities.

If youâ€™d like to have a chat or sign up, please let me know!
