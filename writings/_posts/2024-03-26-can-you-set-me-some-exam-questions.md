If you’re reading this, you probably know what I’m about — obsessive about systems | complexity | cybernetics and public | service | transformation, consultancy, facilitation,  **#systemschange**  and all the rest.

It’s that time of the year — well, it seems to happen about quarterly — where I want to ask people who are reading my stuff what they are getting out of it, what they’d like to see more of, what they would like to hear from me.

So this time I’d like to know — what would you like to ask me?

I’ll answer in the comments if I can, if anything gets a few likes I will definitely write about it… I’d appreciate your input!
